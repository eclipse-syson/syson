All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
All validation rules have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/1030[#1030] [metamodel] The _source_ and _target_ features are no longer editable on all concepts inheriting from `ConnectorAsUsage`.

- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/1093[#1093] [diagrams] Handle TransitionUsage between ActionUsages in diagrams :

The `SysMLElementSerializer` is now used to display the guard expressions on the label of the `TransitionUsages`.
To avoid creating a dependency to _syson-sysml-export_ from the modules holding the _View_ descriptions, all the code that converts a SysML model to its textual format has been moved to _syson-sysml-metamodel_.
As a consequence the following classes have been moved from the package _org.eclipse.syson.sysml.export_ to _org.eclipse.syson.sysml.textual_:

* _SysMLElementSerializer_
* _Appender_
* _NameDeresolver_
* _Severity_
* _Status_
* _SysMLKeywordSwitch_
* _SysMLRelationPredicates_

All matching tests have also been moved.

- [rest-apis] Allow createCommit REST API to amend commit.
`SysMLv2RestDataVersionPayloadSerializerService` has been deleted.
There is no more need for a specific serializer for this `RestDataVersion#payload` attribute, because `RestDataVersion#payload` is now typed with a `Map<String, Object>` instead of `Object`.
The `Map<String, Object>` is handled by the default serializer/deserializer.
`RestDataVersionRequest#payload` is now typed by a `Map<String, Object>` instead of `IRestDataRequest`.

- [test] The integration tests have been refactored.
The initialization SQL scripts have been split in smaller pieces.
The class _SysMLv2Identifiers_ has also been split in:

* _XXXTestProjectData_ : which contains all required data for test on a specific project.
* _SysONRepresentationDescriptionIdentifiers_ : which contains the representation description IDs.

- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/1173[#1173] [export] Fix the textual export of `LiteralString` not wrapped in double quotes.
