== v2024.3.0

=== Breaking changes

- Refactor Node Descriptions Providers in General View: all Definitions and Usages Node Descriptions Providers (e.g. `PartDefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider` or `ItemUsageNodeDescriptionProvider`) have been replaced by two new Node Descriptions Providers: `DefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider` and `UsageNodeDescriptionProvider`.
- Switch to Sirius Web 2024.3.0: `GeneralViewRegistryConfigurer` has been renamed to `GeneralViewDescriptionProvider` as it now implements `IEditingContextRepresentationDescriptionProvider` instead of `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer`. Same for `InterconnectionViewRegistryConfigurer`.
`SysMLv2ObjectService` has been renamed into `SysMLv2LabelService` as it now implements `ILabelServiceDelegate` instead of `IObjectServiceDelegate`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/93[#93] [diagrams] Refactor diagrams code with creation of the diagram-common-view module to gather all cross diagram tools:
  * `DescriptionNameGenerator` is no longer a static class with static methods.
  There should be one name generator per diagram owning the diagram prefix used to prefix all descriptions for this diagram (for instance `GVDescriptionNameGenerator`)

** "newName :" -> set a new name and delete typing
** "newName :>" -> set a new name and delete subsetting/- subclassification
** "newName :>>" -> set a new name and delete redefinition
** "newName =" -> set a new name and delete feature value
** "newName []" -> set a new name and delete the multiplicity range
** ": newType" -> set a new type
** ":> newType" -> set a new subsetting/subclassification
** ":>> newType" -> set a new redefinition
** "= newValue" -> set a new value
** "[newRange]" -> set a new range
