= Install {product} for production

Follow these instructions to install a production-ready version of the application.
This setup is intended for deployment in a live environment, with full multi-user access and all necessary security configurations.

== Get {product}

[CAUTION]
.Stable versions
====
Only `YEAR.MONTH.0` versions are stable and suitable for production deployments.
Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes.
They're not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability.
Always use the stable `.0` releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support.
For more details see xref:user-manual:cycle.adoc[].
====

== Prepare ecosystem

Pay attention to deploying enterprise-grade version of the prerequisites, including the database service.
Before manually deploying the database, it's recommend to use a managed database instance, either provided by the organization's IT service or through cloud services.

[INFO]
====
Before you proceed with the installation, confirm you have  following the xref:requirements.adoc[prerequisites]
====

It's recommended to provide a dedicated host, such as a server or virtual machine, to serve the {product} application, and no other services.

This step provides the following configuration elements :

* database hostname
* database port
* database name
* database username
* database password

[#download]
== Installing {product} Manually

{product} is distributed as a single _executable Java Archive_ `JAR` which has the complete {product} application along with all its dependencies.
This distribution simplifies the setup process, enabling convenient exploration of {product}'s features.

To download the latest pre-built JAR for {product}, follow these steps:

. Before you begin the installation process, navigate to the {packages-url}[download] page for `{product-jar}` to access all versions.
. Identify the {product} latest available version for download.

. Click the latest version to open its specific page.
. In the `Assets` section, locate the JAR file named `{product-jar}`.
+

. Click the JAR file to start the download to your local machine.

This process ensures that you get the most recent version of the {product} application in the form of a pre-built JAR file.

[#secure-app]
== Secure the application

As explain on this xref:installation-guide:how-tos/https.adoc[guide], the {product} application must be secured to ba available on a network.
For a production grade deployment, certificates used to secure the connection must be valid and provided by a valid authority.

Documentation to generate this kind of certificate is provided by dedicated organization, such as https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9422/2290/generating-a-csr-on-tomcat-using-a-keytool/[Namecheap].

The certification authority requires producing a PKCS12 keystore.

This step provides the following configuration elements:

* keystore path
* keystore password
* private key password
* certificate alias name

[#start-app]
== Start the application

To run the application, you'll need to use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the pre-build JAR, {product-jar} xref:how-tos/install/production_deploy.adoc#download[downloaded] earlier.

Go to the folder containing the {product-jar} and run the command:

[source, bash]
----
java -jar path/to/your/syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \
  \
  --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://databaseHost:5433/databaseName \
  --spring.datasource.username=databaseUsername \
  --spring.datasource.password=databasePassword \
    \
  --server.ssl.key-store=path/to/your/keystore.p12 \
  --server.ssl.key-store-password=keyStorePassword \
  --server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12 \
  --server.ssl.key-alias=server \
  --server.ssl.key-password=privateKeyPassword \
    \
  --server.port=443
----

[#openwebbrowser]
== Open your web browser

Navigate to `https://<serverIP>:443` to experience {product}.
