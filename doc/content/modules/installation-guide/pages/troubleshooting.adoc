== Connection refused
If the server fails to start and displays a `Connection refused` error such as:
[source, bash]
----
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'liquibase' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/liquibase/LiquibaseAutoConfiguration$LiquibaseConfiguration.class]: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Connection to localhost:5434 refused.
----

Make sure you have a clean database running without any earlier data, and start the server.
You should delete your existing container `docker rm syson-postgres` and even the image `docker rmi image-ID` to ensure a fresh start.

== Changelog not found
If the server fails to start and displays `changelog.xml not found` error such as:
[source, bash]
----
Application run failed

org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'liquibase' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/liquibase/LiquibaseAutoConfiguration$LiquibaseConfiguration.class]: ERROR: The file 'classpath:db/changelog/syson.db.changelog.xml' was not found.
----

Make sure you have included the correct argument to your `java` command according to your {product} version.

TIP: Check that you are consulting the documentation version that matches the JAR version you are trying to run.

Refer to the xref:installation-guide:how-tos/install.adoc#start-app[] section for detailed instructions according to your version.

== Empty page in web browser
If you encounter an empty page while accessing to {product} through your web browser, it might be because you have installed {product} on a local server or machine and want to access it from another one.

If you open the dev tools of your web browser, you may found the following message: `Uncaught TypeError: crypto.randomUUID is not a function`.

In this case, please refer to xref:installation-guide:how-tos/https.adoc[].
