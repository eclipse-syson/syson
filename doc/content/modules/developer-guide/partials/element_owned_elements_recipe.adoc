= Element owned elements recipe (python script)

Learn how to retrieve owned elements programmatically.
Each recipe includes a detailed explanation, step-by-step instructions, and sample code.

Recipes covered:

* <<get_owned_elements>>: Retrieve owned elements.

[#get_owned_elements]
== Get owned elements
This example demonstrates how to recursively navigate through the hierarchical structure of elements by using the {product} API.
The script starts from a specific element identified by its ID and retrieves its details along with any "owned elements."
The function calls itself recursively to explore all child elements in the hierarchy, printing their names, IDs, and types in an indented format to show the hierarchy visually.

Example script to get owned elements:

[source,python]
.get_owned_element.py
----
include::example$get_owned_elements.py[]
----

*What this code does*:

<1> *Fetches an Element*: Sends a `GET` request to the {product} API to retrieve details about an element specified by its ID.

<2> *Prints Element Details*: Displays the element's name, ID, and type in a formatted, indented way.

<3> *Processes Owned Elements*: Checks for owned elements and calls itself recursively for each one.

<4> *Recursive Traversal*: Continues recursing through hierarchical levels until it explores and prints all owned elements.

This approach helps visualize the structure of complex models or systems, where elements are organized hierarchically.
It highlights how to navigate relationships between elements efficiently by using the {product} API.

Run the script:
[source,bash]
----
$ python get_owned_elements.py

Output example:
