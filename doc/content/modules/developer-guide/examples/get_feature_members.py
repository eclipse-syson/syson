# These examples are adapted from the SysML v2 API Cookbook, available at
# https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-API-Cookbook, maintained by the
# Object Management Group (OMG).
# The original cookbook is designed for use with Jupyter Lab.
# These examples have been adapted to run as standalone Python scripts, making
# them suitable for use in various environments, including SysON.
# They showcase practical usage scenarios and may include additional functionality
# or modifications tailored to specific needs.
