== {sysmlv2} Standard REST APIs

[NOTE]
====
The {sysmlv2} API isn't fully available yet, but we're actively developing it.
In the meantime, you can use the provided file exchange format to ensure interoperability with {product}.
====

{product} focuses on enabling seamless collaboration within the {mbse} - `MBSE` ecosystem.
With a strong emphasis on interoperability, {product} aims to support future standard APIs that will connect to a wide range of modeling tools and resources.

Although we've set standard API implementation as a key development goal, {product} already provides a solid foundation for effective collaboration between tools, reinforcing its role as a powerful platform for MBSE practitioners.


{product}’s commitment to incorporating standard REST APIs and {sysmlv2} textual specifications highlights its dedication to delivering a flexible and interoperable modeling solution.

Refer to the xref:developer-guide:api/api-details.adoc[API Details Section] for more information about the supported APIs.

== {product} GraphQL APIs

{product} also supports a GraphQL API, which allows for flexible and efficient data retrieval.

GraphQL enables clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

This is particularly useful in complex modeling scenarios where different clients may require different subsets of data.

For more information about the GraphQL API, refer to the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web[Sirius Web repository] (on which SysON is built upon) which contains all GraphQL API used by SysON.
