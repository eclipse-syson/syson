= APIs cookbook
The APIs cookbook offers a collection of practical examples and step-by-step instructions to help you interact with {product}’s REST APIs.
It includes ready-to-use code snippets and explanations, allowing you to integrate with other tools, automate tasks, and explore advanced features efficiently.
Each recipe aims for clarity, ease of use, and customizability for different use cases.

== Setup instructions
To get started with the examples, Python is used to interact with {product}’s features and data.
Python offers a powerful way to automate tasks, handle API calls, and process data, making it an ideal choice for this purpose.
Follow the steps after to set up your environment and get everything ready to run the provided code snippets.

=== Step 1: Install required Python libraries
Confirm you have the following Python libraries installed before running the code snippets:

* `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the {sysmlv2} API.
* `pandas`: For organizing and manipulating data.

To install these libraries, run:

`pip install requests pandas`

=== Step 2: Configure {sysmlv2} API access

[source,python]
.init_api.py
----
include::example$init_api.py[]
----

TIP: Replace `http://localhost:8080` with the actual URL of your API server if hosted elsewhere.

*What this code does*:

<1> Define the base host: Assigns the variable `host` with the base URL of the {sysmlv2} API server.

[NOTE]
====
In the examples, the {product} server uses a randomization function to generate unique IDs, so outputs can differ when you run the examples on your project.
====

Other code snippets use this function.
To run it, see the following section about recipes.

=== Step 3: Test code snippets
Once you have configured the {sysmlv2} API access, you can start testing the xref:developer-guide:api-cookbook.adoc#recipes[recipes].

=== Troubleshooting

. *Error Handling*:
** Check endpoint URLs, `project_id`, `commit_id`, and `authentication` tokens if the API returns errors: for example, 400 or 500 status codes.
** Confirm the API is running.
. *Empty Responses*:
** Verify that queried elements exist within the specified project and commit.
** Use the {product} web interface for visual inspection.
. *Recursive Function Depth*:
** For large models, manage recursion depth appropriately.
** Change the logic to handle large datasets by limiting recursion depth.
