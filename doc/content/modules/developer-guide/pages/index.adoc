= Developer guide

This developer guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up your developer environment, contribute to the codebase, and enhance the capability of {product}.

== Retrieving the Source Code

{product} is built upon the https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html[Eclipse Sirius Web] project.
{product} is licensed under the xref:product-legal:index.adoc[(EPL v2)] Open Source license
The source code is openly accessible on GitHub:{source-code-url}

To get the source code, clone the repository using either SSH:

[source, bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:eclipse-syson/syson.git
----

or HTTPS:

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson.git
----

== Setting Up your Development Environment

. Download your coding environment https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tools 4.22.0] (or newer).
. Ensure that m2e version from your environment is >= 2.6.0

+
. Retrieve the source code or fork it if you want to make contribution
. Import _backend_ plugins from {product} repository in your workspace
. Update _settings.xml_ file from your _.m2_ folder to give access to other repositories during the build
  In order to see dependance with access to add in _settings.xml_, have a look on _backend\application\syson-application\pom.xml_
  You need to create https://github.com/settings/tokens[access tokens] on Github to complete _settings.xml_.

+
. Right click on _syson-services_ module and then _Properties>JavaBuildPath>Source_
  Add _main/generated_ folder and remove _excluded_ content and former _antlr/grammar_
  You should retrieve the following _Java build path_

. Update Maven project by launching "ALT+F5" shortcut on all modules of your workspace

== Generate a new version of SysIDE CLI

In the _syson-import_ module, you'll found a `syside-cli-.js` file in `src/main/resources`.
This file is used by the import process, to parse the {sysmlv2} textual files.
If you want to update the version on SysIDE used to parse textual files, you need to generate a new version of this `syside-cli-.js` file.

Here are the steps to follow:

. Clone the https://github.com/sensmetry/sysml-2ls[SysIDE repository] from github.
. Install https://pnpm.io/installation[pnpm].
. Go to the root of your local SysIDE repository.
. Execute `pnpm install` command.
. Execute `pnpm run build`command.
. Execute `pnpm run --dir packages/syside-cli/ esbuild` command.
. It produces a `your_local_syside_repo/packages/syside-cli/out/index.js` file
. Get a copy of the `your-local-syside-repo/packages/syside-cli/out/index.js` file.
. Edit this file:
.. add `#!/usr/bin/env node` as first line
.. add `src_default();` as last line
.. rename it to `syside-cli.js`
. Copy the renamed file into `your_local_syson_repo/backend/application/syson-import/src/main/resources` (overwrite the existing file).

== Generate a new OpenAPI documentation of REST API

. Build and run the syson server locally (using docker compose as example) on `http://localhost:8080`.
. Download the documentation at the url: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/rest-apis`.
. The swagger-ui user interface is `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.
