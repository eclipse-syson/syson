= 2024.3.0

== Key highlights

- *Improved User Interactivity*: New features such as direct editing allow users to change element details seamlessly, without data loss.
This enhances the overall user experience by making it more intuitive and reducing the time required to make changes.
- *Expanded Library and Standard Support*: All {kerml} and {sysmlv2} standard libraries are now included by default.
This expands the tool's capabilities and ensures compatibility with industry standards, making it easier to integrate and reference standard elements in projects.
- *Advanced Filtering*: New filters have been added to the Explorer view, allowing users to hide specific elements and libraries, which simplifies the interface and focuses on relevant data.
- *Import Capabilities*: Additionally, {sysmlv2} textual files can now be imported directly, enhancing data integration and compatibility with other tools.
- *Enhanced Diagram Development*: We've restructured and streamlined our diagrams implementation, including the introduction of specific modules and tools for better cross-diagram functionality.
This ensures that all graphical representations are more cohesive and easier to maintain.

== Breaking changes

- Node Descriptions Providers in General View has been modified with mainly rename of these providers to match with all `Definitions` and `Usages` Node Descriptions.

`SysMLv2ObjectService` has been renamed into `SysMLv2LabelService` as it now implements `ILabelServiceDelegate` instead of `IObjectServiceDelegate`.
- Refactor diagrams code with creation of the diagram-common-view module to gather all cross diagram tools and there is now one name generator per diagram owning the diagram prefix used to prefix all descriptions for this diagram.

== Dependencies update

- `commons-io 2.11.0` dependency has been explicitly added in `syson-application-configuration`.
- Switch to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/releases/tag/v2024.3.0[Sirius Web v2024.3.0]
