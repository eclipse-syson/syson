- Ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed, the following methods have been moved to support this feature
* The method `ToolService#dropElementFromExplorer` has been moved to `ViewToolService` since it now requires view-related imports that motivated this refactoring.
* The method `ToolService#dropElementFromDiagram` has been moved to `ViewToolService` for the sake of consistency.
- Fix _Add Existing Elements_ tool for start and done actions, the following methods have been moved to `UtilService` to make them reusable by different services (they're now used by `ViewNodeService` and `ViewToolService`):
* `ViewNodeService#getAllStandardStartActions`

== Dependencies update

- Switch to Sirius Web 2024.9.0
- Migrate frontend to MUI 5
- Switch to `maven-checkstyle-plugin` 3.4.0

== Bug fixes

- Prevent nested part to be rendered as border nodes in the Interconnection View diagram.
- Fix an issue where a click on inherited members inside compartments was raising an error instead of displaying the palette.
- Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren't correctly imported into the project's editing context.
- Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages.
Memberships of a Type are inherited via _Specialization_ or _Conjugation_, not by composition.
- Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children.
Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation.
- Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements.
- Fix an issue that made the _addExistingElements_ not work properly for _start_ and _done_ actions inside actions and parts.
- Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint.
It's now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint.
- Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment.
- Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an `Element` as graphical node through direct edit.
- Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as `null` instead of their actual name.
- Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram.
- Fix an issue that revealed the _documentation_ compartment when dropping an element on itself.
The drop isn't allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed.
- Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition.
* The tool _Add Part as nested Part_ now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed.
- Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background.
- Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser.


== Improvements

- Add actions in _PartUsage_ and _PartDefinition_
- Add states in _PartUsage_ and _PartDefinition_
- Add _ExhibitStates_ on General View diagram
- Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a _PartUsage_/_PartDefinition_
- Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a _StateUsage_/_StateDefinition_
- The _InterfaceUsage_ created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing _Definition_/_Package_.
- Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code
- Add action node in Interconnection View diagram
- Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram
- Add label support for referential Usages
* Nodes that are references now correctly contain the "ref" keyword
* Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the "ref" keyword
* AttributeUsage don't contain the "ref" keyword since they're always referential
- Add support for "ref" keyword in direct edit
* Prefixing the name of an Usage with "ref" sets it as a reference
* Not setting the "ref" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference)
- Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge
* Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge
* Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge

- Modify the creation of an _ExhibitState_ from a _StateUsage_ or _StateDefinition_.
There is now several tools for creating an _ExhibitState_.
The first one called "New ExhibitState" creates a simple _ExhibitState_.
The second one called "New ExhibitState with referenced State" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing _State_ to associate to the new _ExhibitState_.
- Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements.

image::release-notes-diagram-standard-libraries-elements-qualified-names.png[Qualified names for standard libraries elements]

- Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool.
- Allow to set measurement units via direct edit.
It's now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, for example `mass = 10 [kg]`.
- Allow to select existing _Type_ on Subject tool.
- Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element
- Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element
- Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements
* Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or "abstract" or "variation" or "readonly" or "derived" or "end" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value
* Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with "ordered" or "nonunique" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value
- Add support for constraint expressions in the general view.
Constraints with expressions such as `mass >= 10 [kg]` are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint.
- Add _actors_ compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram.
- Handle the representation of _actors_ on the General View diagram.
Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image.

image::release-notes-actor-representation.png[Actor node on the General View diagram]

- Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram.
The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) can't be reconnected.
- Allow to select existing _RequirementUsage_ and _RequirementDefinition_ on Objective tool.
- Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains `it.only`.
- Add support for public import in direct edit specializations.
It's now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features.
For example, `myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue` now correctly types the attribute with `ISQBase::MassValue`.
- Improve the support of root `Namespaces` in {product} documents.
* Root `Namespaces` are now implicitly created at the root of {product} documents.
* Creating an element at the root of a {product} document now creates it in its root `Namespace`.
* A new filter is available to hide root `Namespaces` and is enabled by default.
* It's no longer possible to create `Namespace` from the explorer.
* It's no longer possible to create a representation on a root `Namespace`.
- Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed.
- Display prefix keywords in labels of `Definitions` and `Usages` graphical nodes.
- Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it's already on the diagram and hidden.
A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container.
- Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of `Definitions` and `Usages` graphical elements.
- DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label.
- Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it.
- Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package.

== New features

- Add "Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the  diagrams (icons aren't part of the {sysmlv2} specification).

image::release-notes-show-hide-icons-in-diagram.png[Show/Hide Icons in Diagram]

- Add new tools allowing to create an _ExhibitState_ at the root of General View and StateTransition View.
The first one called "New ExhibitState" creates a simple _ExhibitState_.
The second one called "New ExhibitState with referenced State" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing _State_ to associate to the new _ExhibitState_.
The selected _State_ will be added to the diagram, not the new _ExhibitState_.
- Handle _FlowConnectionUsage_ between _PortUsages_ in Interconnection View.
A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports.
- Add tools to set a _Feature_ as composite or reference.
- Handle _ItemUsage_ in Interconnection View and _FlowConnectionUsage_ using items as their source/target.
- Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element.
This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element.
If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a _Documentation_ element and will associate it to the selected element.
- Add new "New objects from text" menu entry on elements in _Explorer_ view, allowing to insert textual {sysmlv2} as objects under the selected element.
The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual {sysmlv2}.

image::release-notes-insert-textual-sysmlv2-menu.png[New objects from text menu]

A click on the _Insert_ button converts the textual {sysmlv2} into model elements and add them under the selected element.

image::release-notes-insert-textual-sysmlv2-dialog.png[New objects from text dialog]

- Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content.
- Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions.
- Add "Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams.

image::release-notes-show-hide-inherited-members-in-diagram.png[Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagram]
