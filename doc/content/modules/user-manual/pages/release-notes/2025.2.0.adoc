= 2025.2.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to SysMLv2 Beta 2.3 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to SysMLv2 and KerML Beta 2.3 specifications released on December 2024 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).

- *Add validation rules*: SysON now implements the constraints (a.k.a. validation rules) from the SysMLv2 specification.
The _Validation_ view shows the results of the execution of the constraints on your models.

- *Right-click to display contextual menu (a.k.a. palette)*: In all diagrams, the contextual menu is now available on right-click instead of left-click.

- *Drag and drop in Explorer view* : Users can now move semantic elements using a drag and drop operation in the _Explorer_ view.

- *Undo/redo*: Users can now undo and redo any semantic change (i.e. in _Explorer_ and _Details_ views) with "CTRL + z" and "CTRL + y".
Undo/redo is not available yet in diagrams.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the server could crash when successive REST APIs calls are executed.
More precisely, the dates fields were not serialized correctly.
- Fix an issue where default names of `Elements` were sometimes invalid because corresponding to SysMLv2 keywords.
New default names now include a number, this number corresponding to the count of `Elements` of the same kind in the scope.
For example, if a `PartDefinition` already defines 5 parts, then a new `Part` created under this `PartDefinition` would have _part6_ for name.
- Fix an issue where downloading of standard libraries pointed at 404 error.
They are now properly downloaded.
Export to textual SysMLv2 is not fully implemented yet so there are still unhandled cases.
- Fix `Port Usage` labels in diagrams (feature typing was incorrectly duplicated).
- In diagrams, labels of `Usages` (e.g.: `Attribute Usages`) with a `Feature Value` relationship having the _initial_ property set to true now use the ":=" symbol instead of "=".
- In diagrams, labels of `Usages` (e.g.: `Attribute Usages`) with a `Feature Value` relationship having the _default_ property set to true now display the _default_ keyword.
- In the `General View` diagram, the multiplicity is no longer displayed on graphical edges to conform to the SysMLv2 specification.
- In the `General View` diagram, fix an issue where the execution of `New Port In/Inout/Out` tools was failing.

== New features

- A new view named _Query_ is available in SysON, allowing users to query the models.

This view allows to write AQL queries (see https://eclipse.dev/acceleo/documentation/[AQL documentation] for more details) and get the results of the queries written.
Please read the xref:user-manual:features/query-view.adoc[Query view section] in this documentation for more details.

- The _Validation_ view now displays the result of the execution of the constraints (a.k.a. validation rules) from the SysMLv2 specification.

- Users can now move semantic elements using the drag and drop operation in the _Explorer_ view (i.e. move tree items inside the _Explorer_ view).

- Users can now undo and redo any semantic change (i.e. in _Explorer_ and _Details_ views) with "CTRL + z" and "CTRL + y".
Undo/redo is not available yet in diagrams.

- A minimap is now available on all diagrams, at the bottom right corner.
This minimap allows to see the whole diagram in a small square, it highlights the current viewport, and allows to click/drag/scroll the minimap to navigate the diagram.

== Improvements

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Concern Definition` objects.
The creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Concern Definition` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Concern Usage` objects.
The creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Concern Usage` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

- The `General View` diagram now displays the _stakeholders_ of `Concern Definition`, `Concern Usage`, `Requirement Definition` and `Requirement Usage` objects.

- In the `General View` diagram, the stakeholder creation tool displays available `Part Usages` in a tree instead of a list.

- In the `General View` diagram, the actor creation tool displays available `Part Usages` in a tree instead of a list.

- Prevent the edition of imported user libraries from the details view.
- Align metamodel to SysMLv2 and KerML Beta 2.3 specifications.
The changes are:
* `TransitionUsage`
** new operation `sourceFeature() : Feature`
* New class `TerminateActionUsage`
** with new derived reference `terminatedOccurrenceArgument : Expression`
- All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysML Beta 2.3 specification.
- In addition to the export as SVG, you can now export diagrams as PNG images.

- `Membership#isDistinguishableFrom` derived attribute has been implemented in the metamodel.

- The following concepts are now handled by the export to textual SysMLv2 module:
* `Concern Definition`
* `Concern Usage`
* `Stakeholder Membership`

- In the `General View` diagram, `Package` and `Namespace Import` graphical nodes can now be resized smaller than their default size.
- Display in the _Details_ view the properties _isDefault_ and _isInitial_ in Core tab of `Feature Value` concept.
- Fix an issue where the diagram direct edit on graphical nodes could raise a backend error on unsettable enum attributes.

== Dependency update

- Switch to Sirius Web 2025.1.7
- Switch to SysIDE 0.8.0
