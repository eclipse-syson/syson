= 2025.2.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to SysMLv2 Beta 2.3 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to SysMLv2 and KerML Beta 2.3 specifications released on December 2024 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).

- *Add validation rules*: SysON now implements the constraints (a.k.a. validation rules) from the SysMLv2 specification.
The _Validation_ view show the results of the execution of the constraints on your models.

== Breaking changes


== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the server could crash when successive REST APIs calls are executed.
More precisely, the dates fields were not serialized correctly.
- Fix an issue where default names of `Elements` were sometimes invalid because corresponding to SysMLv2 keywords.
New default names now includes a number, this number corresponding to the count of `Elements` of the same kind in the scope.
For example, if a `PartDefinition` already define 5 parts, then a new `Part` created under this `PartDefinition` would have _part6_ for name.

== New features

- A new experimental view named _Query_ is available in SysON, allowing to query the models.

image::release-notes-query-view.png[Query View, width=85%,height=85%]

This view allows to write AQL queries (see https://eclipse.dev/acceleo/documentation/[AQL documentation] for more details) and get the results of the queries written.
[WARNING]
====
This view comes from https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html[Sirius Web], the software on which SysON is based upon.
It will be improved release after release, with new variables and services, but it is experimental for now.
====
Only one variable is accessible for now, `editingContext` which represent the current project.
From this context, you can use the following services:

- `Collection<Object> allContents()`: allows to retrieve all contents recursively (documents, and each element of all models) present in your editing context.
Please use this service very carefully as it can retrieve thousands elements very easily and may also lead to performance issues.
- `Collection<Object> contents()`: allows to retrieve all contents (documents) present in your editing context.
- `Object getObjectById(String id)`: from its ID, allows to retrieve an object (a document or a {sysmlv2} model Element) present in your editing context.

[WARNING]
====
The use of this _Query_ view requires knowledge of AQL and also a good knowledge of the {sysmlv2} language (attributes, references, operations).
====
Here are some examples of AQL queries applied on a simple project:
- The following example uses the `getObjectById` service with an ID as parameter, corresponding to the _Package 1_ element (its ID has been retrieved from the _Advanced_ tab in _Details_ view).

image::release-notes-query-view-getObjectById.png[Query View getObjectById, width=85%,height=85%]

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_Package 1_).

- The following example uses the `ownedMember` reference from the SysMLv2 language, applied on _Package 1_ element.

image::release-notes-query-view-ownedMember.png[Query View ownedMember, width=85%,height=85%]

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_part1_ and _action1_).
In this case it corresponds to the members of _Package 1_ that you can also see in the _Explorer_ view on the left side of the screenshot above.

- The _Validation_ view now displays the result of the execution of the constraints (a.k.a. validation rules) from the SysMLv2 specification.

== Improvements

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Concern Definition` objects.
The creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Concern Definition` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Concern Usage` objects.
The creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Concern Usage` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

image::release-notes-gv-concern-usage.png[Concern Usage node creation tool, width=50%, height=50%]

- The `General View` diagram now displays the _stakeholders_ of `Concern Definition`, `Concern Usage`, `Requirement Definition` and `Requirement Usage` objects.

- Prevent the edition of imported user libraries from the details view.
- Align metamodel to SysMLv2 and KerML Beta 2.3 specifications.
The changes are:
* `TransitionUsage`
** new operation `sourceFeature() : Feature`
* New class `TerminateActionUsage`
** with new derived reference `terminatedOccurrenceArgument : Expression`
- All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysML Beta 2.3 specification.
- In addition to the export as SVG, you can now export diagrams as PNG images.
