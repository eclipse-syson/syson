= 2026.3.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== New features

- SysON can now be connected with Elasticsearch to support cross-project search.
The Elasticsearch integration uses its own indexing logic instead of the default one provided by Sirius Web.
This allows to keep indices compact, and ensures information stored in the indices are useful to perform cross-project search.
You can find more information on how to setup Elasticsearch, how elements are mapped to index documents, and how to query them in the documentation.

This feature is currently considered experimental.
Try it out and give feedback by reporting bugs and suggesting new features.
It's not recommended for production use.
