= 2025.4.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to SysMLv2 Beta 2.4 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to SysMLv2 and KerML 2024-12 specifications released on December 2024 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).
All existing models/projects in WysON will be automatically migrated to this new version.
In any case, please download all your existing models/projects before upgrading to 2025.4.0 (as always).


== Breaking changes

- A `SuccessionUsage` now computes its _source_ and _target_ from the properties _sourceFeature_ and _targetFeature_.
It might causes some `SuccessionUsage` not to be displayed correctly in diagrams if they were starting or ending from an inherited standard library `ActionUsage` (such as `start` or `done)`.
In such cases, delete the `SuccessionUsage` graphical node and recreate it graphically (e.g. by drag&drop or with _Add existing element_ tool).

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue while computing the name of `VariantMembership`.
This has an impact on name resolution against `Element` contained in `VariantMembership` during the textual import process (e.g. for `EnumerationUsage` literals in `EnumerationDefinition`). 
- Fix resolution of "unrestricted" names. For example, while importing the following model, the reference to _'p 2'::'A 1'_ is now properly resolved.

```
package p1 {
    package 'p 2' {
        action def 'A 1';
    }
    action 'a 2' : 'p 2'::'A 1';
}
```
- Fix a problem encountered during the import of a SysML textual file in a specific model configuration. The model incorrectly resolved the target of a `Redefinition` when a name conflict was detected.
- Fix an issue that prevented the export functionality to correctly produce qualified name for elements referenced in `FeatureReferenceExpression`.
- In `Explorer View`, the fold/unfold arrow is now also available for non-sysml model elements.

== New features

- The SysML contents of a project may now be published as a library.
The command palette now contains a dedicated command to do so.

image::release-notes-publication-command.png[Publication command, width=85%,height=85%]

Note that it is only available for projects with documents containing SysML elements as their root contents.
The publication process only publishes the SysML contents.

image::release-notes-publication-model.png[Publication command, width=85%,height=85%]

Upon selecting this command, a dialog prompts for the library information.

image::release-notes-publication-dialog.png[Publication command dialog, width=85%,height=85%]

When the publication is successful, a success notification appears.
Otherwise, an error notification appears, e.g. when trying to publish a library in a version that already exists.

image::release-notes-publication-success.png[Publication success notification, width=85%,height=85%]

After publication, the library is listed in `<baseUrl>/libraries/`.
This page is also accessible from the 'help' menu in the top right corner of the application.

image::release-notes-publication-libraries-menu.png[Libraries menu, width=85%,height=85%]

This page lists all the libraries published in the application.

image::release-notes-publication-libraries.png[Libraries, width=85%,height=85%]

Opening a library displays it as a read-only project.

- All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
- All validation rules have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
- In `General View` and `State Transition View` diagrams, when `Packages` labels exceed the available space, an ellipsis is added to provide a visual indication that the
name is truncated.

image::release-notes-package-name-ellipsis-overflow.png[Package name overflow with ellipsis, width=85%,height=85%]

- In diagrams, the direct edit tool on `Feature` elements now allows to use the ":=" and "default" symbols (see for more details in xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#direct-edit[user documentation] ).
- It is now possible to create a `General View` diagram under root namespace elements.

image::release-notes-create-diagram-on-root-namespace-element.png[Create diagram on root namespace element, width=50%, height=50%]

- In the `General View` diagram, the subject creation tool displays available `Usages` in a tree instead of a list.

image::release-notes-gv-subject-creation-selection-dialog-tree.png['subject creation tool selection dialog tree' compartment, width=50%, height=50%]

- Improve handling of `SuccessionAsUsage` textual import with implicit _source_ property.
For example importing the following SysMLv2 content would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a2;
    action a3;
    first start;
    then a2;
    then a3;
}
```

The textual export module has also be improved to produce the same file than the one imported.

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects.
A new creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

image::release-notes-gv-satisfy-requirement-usage.png[Satisfy Requirement Usage node creation tool, width=50%, height=50%]

- The `General View` diagram is now proposed first when creating a diagram.
- It is now possible, in diagrams, to reduce the width of `Usages` (e.g. `Part`) and `Definition` (e.g. `Part Definition`) graphical nodes with a long name as their label can now be wrapped.

- Improve textual import of `SuccessionAsUsage` which define a new target action directly after the 'then' keyword.
For example importing the following SysML file would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    first start;
    then action a1;
    then action a2;
}
```
- Improve textual export of `SuccessionAsUsage` by properly handle its _name_.
For example exporting a model of an `ActionDefinition` containing two `ActionUsages` and a named `SuccessionAsUsage` would produce the following file:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    succession s1 first a1 then a2;
}
```
- Improve `PortDefinition` textual import by creating the required `ConjugatedPort` during the import process.

- Improve textual import of `TransitionUsage` by handling _implicit_ source property.
In the following example, the source of outgoing `TransitionUsages` of the `DecisionNode` are now properly resolved.

```
action a0 {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    action a1;
    action a2;
    action a3;
    action a4;
   
    attribute attr1 : Real;
    first a0 then d1;
    decide d1;
        if x >= 2 then a1; // Source is d1
        if x >= 1 and x < 2 then a3; // Source is d1
        else a4; // Source is d1
}
```

- Improve the textual import of `TransitionUsage` by handling guards.
The import can now handle `OperatorExpression` such has:

```
action a0 {
    attribute attr1 : Real;
    succession S first start if x < 0.0 then done;
}
```
- Implement `ConnectionDefinition` derived references and operations in SysON SysMLv2 metamodel.
- `TransitionUsages` can now be displayed and created in the _General View_ and _Action Flow_ diagrams.
Be aware that the guard expressions are displayed in the label but *can't* be edited yet using the direct edit tool.

- Update Batmobile project example by fixing some of the issues found in the model:

* Improvements on `SuccessionAsUsage` and `TransitionUsage`
* Improvements of _General View_ diagram to be be able to represent the "Drive Batmobile" action definition.

image::DriveBatmobileActionFlow.png[Drive Batmobile ActionDefinition representation, width=85%,height=85%]

- Simplify handling of "start" and "done" `ActionUsages`.
Those elements can now be displayed without the special `Membership` previously used to "import" them in the parent.

- The tool "Add Existing Elements" is now directly available from the Action Flow compartement in the General View Diagram.
- Add support for implicit redefinition of `Behavior` and `Step` parameters
Parameters of `Behavior` and `Step` now implicitly redefine the matching parameters of `Behavior` subclassifications and `Step` specializations.
See KerML 7.4.7.2 and 7.4.7.3 for more information.
These implicit redefinitions are not visible in the diagrams nor the explorer (like all the other implicit specializations).
The importer can now import SysML files that contain `FeatureChainingExpression` relying on these implicit redefinitions.
- An edge is now displayed between `OccurrenceDefinition` its nested `OccurrenceUsages`.

image::NestedOccurrenceUsageEdge.png[Nested Occurrence Usage Edge, width=85%,height=85%]

- It is now possible, in diagrams, to reduce the width of `NamespaceImport` graphical nodes with a long name as their label can now be wrapped.
