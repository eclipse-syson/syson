= 2025.4.0 (work in progress)

== Breaking changes

- A `SuccessionUsage` now computes its _source_ and _target_ from the properties _sourceFeature_ and _targetFeature_.
It might causes some `SuccessionUsage` not to be displayed correctly in diagrams if they were starting or ending from an inherited standard library `ActionUsage` (such as `start` or `done)`.
In such cases, delete the `SuccessionUsage` graphical node and recreate it graphically (e.g. by drag&drop or with _Add existing element_ tool).

== Bug fixes

== New features

== Improvements

- In `General View` and `State Transition View` diagrams, when `Packages` labels exceed the available space, an ellipsis is added to provide a visual indication that the
name is truncated.

- In diagrams, the direct edit tool on `Feature` elements now allows to use the ":=" and "default" symbols (see for more details in xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#direct-edit[user documentation] ).
- It is now possible to create a `General View` diagram under root namespace elements.

- In the `General View` diagram, the subject creation tool displays available `Usages` in a tree instead of a list.

- Improve handling of `SuccessionAsUsage` textual import with implicit _source_ property.
For example importing the following SysMLv2 content would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a2;
    action a3;
    first start;
    then a2;
    then a3;
}
```

The textual export module has also be improved to produce the same file than the one imported.

- The `General View` diagram now supports `Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects.
A new creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

- The `General View` diagram is now proposed first when creating a diagram.
- It is now possible, in diagrams, to reduce the width of `Usages` (e.g. `Part`) and `Definition` (e.g. `Part Definition`) graphical nodes with a long name as their label can now be wrapped.

- Improve textual import of `SuccessionAsUsage` which define a new target action directly after the 'then' keyword.
For example importing the following SysML file would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    first start;
    then action a1;
    then action a2;
}
```
- Improve textual export of `SuccessionAsUsage` by properly handle its _name_.
For example exporting a model of an `ActionDefinition` containing two `ActionUsages` and a named `SuccessionAsUsage` would produce the following file:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    succession s1 first a1 then a2;
}
```
- Improve `PortDefinition` textual import by creating the required `ConjugatedPort` during the import process.

== Dependency update

- Switch to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.4.3[Spring Boot 3.4.3].
- Switch to Sirius Web 2025.2.1
