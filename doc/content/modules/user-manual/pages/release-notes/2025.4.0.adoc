= 2025.4.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to SysMLv2 Beta 2.4 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to SysMLv2 and KerML 2024-12 specifications released on December 2024 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).
All existing models/projects in SysON will be automatically migrated to this new version.
In any case, please download all your existing models/projects before upgrading to 2025.4.0 (as always).

- *Libraries publication/import*: the SysML contents of a project may now be published as a library.
After publication, the library is listed in `<baseUrl>/libraries/`.
Projects may now import published libraries.
Projects may now update the version of a published library they depend on.
More details at xref:user-manual:features/publication.adoc[Publication section] and xref:user-manual:features/library-import.adoc[Library import section] in this documentation for more details.

== Breaking changes

- A `SuccessionUsage` now computes its _source_ and _target_ from the properties _sourceFeature_ and _targetFeature_.
It might causes some `SuccessionUsage` not to be displayed correctly in diagrams if they were starting or ending from an inherited standard library `ActionUsage` (such as `start` or `done)`.
In such cases, delete the `SuccessionUsage` graphical node and recreate it graphically (e.g. by drag&drop or with _Add existing element_ tool).

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue while computing the name of `VariantMembership`.
This has an impact on name resolution against `Element` contained in `VariantMembership` during the textual import process (e.g. for `EnumerationUsage` literals in `EnumerationDefinition`). 
- Fix resolution of "unrestricted" names. For example, while importing the following model, the reference to _'p 2'::'A 1'_ is now properly resolved.

```
package p1 {
    package 'p 2' {
        action def 'A 1';
    }
    action 'a 2' : 'p 2'::'A 1';
}
```
- Fix a problem encountered during the import of a SysML textual file in a specific model configuration. The model incorrectly resolved the target of a `Redefinition` when a name conflict was detected.
- Fix an issue that prevented the export functionality to correctly produce qualified name for elements referenced in `FeatureReferenceExpression`.
- In `Explorer View`, the fold/unfold arrow is now also available for non-sysml model elements.
- Fix computation of `SuccessionAsUsage.getSourceFeature()` derived reference when using implicit source such as in the following example:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action ax2;
    action ax1;
    then ax2;
    then decide; // <- The source is ax1
}
```
- Fix an issue on import that set the default `TransitionFeatureKind` value on accept and do `TransitionFeatureMembership`
Importing an "accept" `TransitionFeatureMembership` now correctly sets its kind to `trigger`.
Importing a "do" `TransitionFeatureMembership` now explicitly sets its kind to `effect`.
- Fix an issue on import that set the default `RequirementConstraintKind` value on require and assume `RequirementConstraintMembership`
Importing a "require" `RequirementConstraintMembership` now correctly sets its kind to `requirement`.
Importing an "assume" `RequirementConstraintMembership` now explicitly sets its kind to `assumption`.
- Fix import of `TextualRepresentation` to clean _language_ and _body_ properties.
They no longuer contain the extra characters:

* _/*_
* _*/_
* _"_

- Uniformize the import of `LiteralString`.
The `value` field of imported `LiteralString` elements does not contain double quotes anymore.
This behavior is aligned with how SysON handles quotes in `declaredName` fields.
- Fix the textual export of `LiteralString` not wrapped in double quotes.
The user had to explicitly add the double quotes around a `LiteralString` value to ensure the export was producing valid SysML.
This is not the case anymore.

- Fix the creation of `TransitionUsage` from an `ActionUsage` to the "Done" ActionUsage.
- Fix the value of the `isLibraryElement` attribute for elements inside `LibraryPackage`.
The attribute is now correctly `true` for elements contained in the ownership tree of a `LibraryPackage`.

== New features

- The SysML contents of a project may now be published as a library.
The command palette now contains a dedicated command to do so.

image::release-notes-publication-command.png[Publication command, width=65%,height=65%]

Note that it is only available for projects with documents containing SysML elements as their root contents.
The publication process only publishes the SysML contents.

image::release-notes-publication-model.png[Publication command, width=30%,height=30%]

Upon selecting this command, a dialog prompts for the library information.

image::release-notes-publication-dialog.png[Publication command dialog, width=85%,height=85%]

When the publication is successful, a success notification appears.
Otherwise, an error notification appears, e.g. when trying to publish a library in a version that already exists.

image::release-notes-publication-success.png[Publication success notification, width=85%,height=85%]

After publication, the library is listed in `<baseUrl>/libraries/`.
This page is also accessible from the 'help' menu in the top right corner of the application.

image::release-notes-publication-libraries-menu.png[Libraries menu, width=85%,height=85%]

This page lists all the libraries published in the application.

image::release-notes-publication-libraries.png[Libraries, width=85%,height=85%]

Opening a library displays it as a read-only project.

image::release-notes-publication-library.png[Libraries, width=85%,height=85%]

- Projects may now import published libraries.
The command palette now contains a dedicated command to do so.

image::release-notes-publication-import-command.png[Import published library command, width=65%,height=65%]

This command is available for any project to import any library.

Upon selecting this command, a dialog prompts for the libraries to import.

image::release-notes-publication-import-dialog.png[Import published library command dialog, width=85%,height=85%]

The import is done either by "reference" or by "copy".
With the former, the contents of the library are accessed in read-only mode.
With the latter, a copy of the contents of the library are copied into the project, and they may be used and edited as if they had been manually created into the project.

image::release-notes-publication-import-choices.png[Import published library command dialog, width=85%,height=85%]

Upon importing:

- If one of the selected libraries is already imported (same namespace, name and version) then it will not be imported a second time.
- Dependencies are re-loaded, which may trigger imported libraries to re-appear in the Explorer view if they had been manually removed.

Upon a successful import, a notification appears in the bottom right corner.

image::release-notes-publication-import-success.png[Import published library command success notification, width=30%,height=30%]

The project contents are updated.

image::release-notes-publication-import-result.png[Project contents after successfully importing a published library, width=50%,height=50%]

If a document from an imported-by-reference library has a root element that is an instance of `LibraryPackage`, then that document is displayed under the 'User libraries' node in the 'Explorer' view.

image::release-notes-publication-import-user-library.png[Imported published library under User libraries, width=50%,height=50%]

- Projects may now update the version of a published library they depend on.

In the Explorer view, the contextual menu on documents from imported-by-reference published libraries now contains an entry to update the version of the library dependency.

image::release-notes-library-update-action.png[Contextual menu action 'Update library' for documents from imported-by-reference published libraries, width=30%,height=30%]

Upon selecting this action, a dialog prompts for the new version of the library to use.

image::release-notes-library-update-dialog.png[Dialog for the 'Update library' action, width=85%,height=85%]

After the library update has been performed, if successful, a notification appears.

image::release-notes-library-update-success.png[Dialog for the 'Update library' action, width=30%,height=30%]

Updating a library means that the contents of the project are updated.
Libraries may add, remove or edit their contents between versions.
This means projects may become invalid because some of the library elements it was built upon no longer exist, or their identity has changed.

- All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
- All validation rules have been updated to comply with the SysMLv2 2024-12 specification.
- In _General View_ and _State Transition View_ diagrams, when `Packages` labels exceed the available space, an ellipsis is added to provide a visual indication that the
name is truncated.

image::release-notes-package-name-ellipsis-overflow.png[Package name overflow with ellipsis, width=85%,height=85%]

- In diagrams, the direct edit tool on `Feature` elements now allows to use the ":=" and "default" symbols (see for more details in xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#direct-edit[user documentation] ).
- It is now possible to create a _General View_ diagram under root namespace elements.

image::release-notes-create-diagram-on-root-namespace-element.png[Create diagram on root namespace element, width=50%, height=50%]

- In the _General View_ diagram, the subject creation tool displays available `Usages` in a tree instead of a list.

image::release-notes-gv-subject-creation-selection-dialog-tree.png['subject creation tool selection dialog tree' compartment, width=50%, height=50%]

- Improve handling of `SuccessionAsUsage` textual import with implicit _source_ property.
For example importing the following SysMLv2 content would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a2;
    action a3;
    first start;
    then a2;
    then a3;
}
```

The textual export module has also be improved to produce the same file than the one imported.

- The _General View_ diagram now supports `Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects.
A new creation tool can be found in the `Requirements` section of the palette.
`Satisfy Requirement Usage` objects may also be drag-and-dropped from the _Explorer_ onto the diagram background.

image::release-notes-gv-satisfy-requirement-usage.png[Satisfy Requirement Usage node creation tool, width=50%, height=50%]

- The _General View_ diagram is now proposed first when creating a diagram.
- It is now possible, in diagrams, to reduce the width of `Usages` (e.g. `Part`) and `Definition` (e.g. `Part Definition`) graphical nodes with a long name as their label can now be wrapped.

- Improve textual import of `SuccessionAsUsage` which define a new target action directly after the 'then' keyword.
For example importing the following SysML file would now create a valid semantic model:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    first start;
    then action a1;
    then action a2;
}
```
- Improve textual export of `SuccessionAsUsage` by properly handle its _name_.
For example exporting a model of an `ActionDefinition` containing two `ActionUsages` and a named `SuccessionAsUsage` would produce the following file:

```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    succession s1 first a1 then a2;
}
```
- Improve `PortDefinition` textual import by creating the required `ConjugatedPort` during the import process.

- Improve textual import of `TransitionUsage` by handling _implicit_ source property.
In the following example, the source of outgoing `TransitionUsages` of the `DecisionNode` are now properly resolved.

```
action a0 {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    action a1;
    action a2;
    action a3;
    action a4;
   
    attribute attr1 : Real;
    first a0 then d1;
    decide d1;
        if x >= 2 then a1; // Source is d1
        if x >= 1 and x < 2 then a3; // Source is d1
        else a4; // Source is d1
}
```

- Improve the textual import of `TransitionUsage` by handling guards.
The import can now handle `OperatorExpression` such has:

```
action a0 {
    attribute attr1 : Real;
    succession S first start if x < 0.0 then done;
}
```
- Implement `ConnectionDefinition` derived references and operations in SysON SysMLv2 metamodel.
- `TransitionUsages` can now be displayed and created in the _General View_ and _Action Flow_ diagrams.
Be aware that the guard expressions are displayed in the label but *can't* be edited yet using the direct edit tool.

- Update Batmobile project example by fixing some of the issues found in the model:

* improvements on `SuccessionAsUsage` and `TransitionUsage`
* represent the "Drive Batmobile" action definition on the _General View_ diagram

image::DriveBatmobileActionFlow.png[Drive Batmobile ActionDefinition representation, width=85%,height=85%]

- Simplify handling of "start" and "done" `ActionUsages`.
Those elements can now be displayed without the special `Membership` previously used to "import" them in the parent.

- The tool "Add Existing Elements" is now directly available from the Action Flow compartment in the _General View_ Diagram.
- Add support for implicit redefinition of `Behavior` and `Step` parameters
Parameters of `Behavior` and `Step` now implicitly redefine the matching parameters of `Behavior` subclassifications and `Step` specializations.
See KerML 7.4.7.2 and 7.4.7.3 for more information.
These implicit redefinitions are not visible in the diagrams nor the explorer (like all the other implicit specializations).
The importer can now import SysML files that contain `FeatureChainingExpression` relying on these implicit redefinitions.
- An edge is now displayed between `OccurrenceDefinition` its nested `OccurrenceUsages`.

image::NestedOccurrenceUsageEdge.png[Nested Occurrence Usage Edge, width=40%,height=40%]

- It is now possible, in diagrams, to reduce the width of `NamespaceImport` graphical nodes with a long name as their label can now be wrapped.

image::namespace-import-wrapped-label.png[NamesapceImport wrapped label, width=40%,height=40%]

- Improve the name used in exported files of objects referenced by an implicit `Specialization`.
For example, the name used to reference the "start" `ActionUsage` in the following model has been improved:

.Before
```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a2;
    first Actions::Action::start then a2;
}
```

.After
```
action def ActionDef1 {
    action a2;
    first start then a2;
}
```

- Support the textual export of `TransitionUsage` owned by `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` such as:

```
action def A1 {
    private import ScalarValues::Integer;
    attribute x : Integer;
    action a1;
    action a2;
    first a1 if x == 1 then a2;
    succession s1 first a1 if x > 1 & x < 2 then a2;
    succession s2 first a1 if x > 2 & x < 3 then a2;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `DecisionNode` such as:

```
action def A1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    action a3;
    attribute x : ScalarValues::Real;
    decide decision1;
    if x >= 2.1 then a1;
    if x >= 1.1 and x < 2.1 then a2;
    else a3;
}
```  
- In _General View_ diagram, `PortUsage` are now represented as border nodes on `PartUsage` nodes.

image::gv-port-as-border-node.png[Port as border node, width=60%,height=60%]

- Allow to properly import libraries as copies if they have been created from models imported from textual SysML
Models imported from textual SysML that contain `LibraryPackage` were always read-only, even when published as libraries and imported by the user.
This conflicted with the expected behavior of the _import by copy_ feature, which should allow the user to edit the content of the imported library.
- Use a _textarea_ widget to be able to edit multiline string properties in the _Details_ view.
This is visible on the "body" property on:

* `Comment`
* `Documentation`
* `TextualRepresentation`

- `TextualRepresentations` can now be displayed and edited in the _General View_ diagram.

image::GV_TextualRepresentation.png[TextualRepresentation on General View Diagram, width=40%,height=40%]

- The navigation bar menu icon has been updated (from a question mark to a "classic" menu icon).
At the beginning of SysON, it had sense because the only menu entry (i.e. a link) available on this menu was the documentation.
Now, it also includes a menu entry to the projects page and a menu entry to the libraries page.

image::release-notes-navigation-bar-menu-icon.png[navigation bar menu icon, width=85%,height=85%]

- Add new SysMLv2 Library template allowing to create a project composed with a simple model with only one element: a `LibraryPackage`.
This template is visible on the home page (like SysMlv2 and Batmobile templates).

- Implement textual export of `TextualRepresentation` such as:

```
 action def P1 {
    language "naturalLanguage"
        /* some comment
        some other comment */
    rep l2 language "naturalLanguage2"
        /* some comment 3 */
}
```
- In _General View_ diagram, `Comments` can now be created from a `Dependency` graphical edge or a `TransitionUsage` graphical edge, using the graphical edge contextual menu (a.k.a. the palette).

image::release-notes-gv-comment-on-dependency.png[Comment on Dependency, width=85%,height=85%]

- In _General View_ diagram, `PortUsage` now have edges tools to create three types of edges:

* `BindingConnectorAsUsage`
* `InterfaceUsage`
* `FlowConnectionUsage`

image::gv-port-edge-tools.png[Port edge tools, width=60%,height=60%]
