= 2024.5.0

== Key highlights

- *Expanded Diagram and Model Support*: We've significantly expanded our support for various views, including the addition of representations for use cases, occurrences, and allocations.
This enhancement provides more comprehensive tools to visualize and manage {sysmlv2} models.
This includes the addition of diagrams for use cases, occurrences, and allocations.
- *Improved User Experience*: We've improved how elements are displayed, particularly in terms of ports and compartments.
These enhancements ensure a clearer and more intuitive user interface.
- *Increased Stability and Reliability*: We've addressed several key bugs and stability issues including fixing problems with diagrams and import capabilities.
These improvements help maintain the integrity and accuracy of semantic data.
- *First Export Capability*:  Our enhanced integration of SysIDE now supports better integration of the {sysmlv2} format.
We're now able to export projects in the standard textual format, facilitating easier data sharing and compatibility with other industry-standard tools.
This promotes better data exchange and collaboration.

== Breaking changes

- The `requirement-view` diagram has been introduced by error in the last release.
This diagram isn't defined in the {sysmlv2} specification.
It has been deleted in this release.

== Dependencies update

- Switch to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/releases/tag/v2024.5.0[Sirius Web v2024.5.0]
- Switch to @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.4.9
- Add dependency to org.apache.commons.commons-text 1.10.0

== Bug fixes

- The "Add existing elements (recursive)" has been modified to work on `PartUsage`.
- From {iv} diagram, attributes compartment has been added in children `PartUsage` nodes.

- No error is raised anymore when setting a valid new value (with primitive type) in the Details view.
- The body feature of a `Comment` remove now the "/\*" and "*/" characters while importing a model from {sysml} textual format.
- All `Memberships` are now contained in their parent through `ownedRelatedElement` instead of `ownedRelationship` reference.
- Rename action from explorer is now renaming tree items as expected.
- `EnumerationDefinition` is now created with a default name.

- "Add existing element (recursive)" action has been updated to create child nodes for nested and owned usages at the root of the diagram.
- While importing some of the standard examples, there are no more exception mainly when some of examples are linked to non resolved elements.
- Hide capabilities have been restored and improved in the palette.
It's now possible to hide a node but also all its content (recursive) or simply direct content (Show valued content action).

- `Namespace.getImportedMemberships` method now prevents name collisions as stated in the specification ({kerml} 7.2.5.4 Imports).
-  Non end Usages have been removed from AllocationDefinition ends compartment.

- Circular containment of nested parts including self containment are now forbidden.

- Time performance has been improved when using `Become nested part` edge creation tool.
- `state transition` and `actions` compartments are now available on `StateDefinition` and `StateUsage` node.

- Inherited features in compartments don't display itself anymore.

image::release-notes-inherited-feature-cpt.png[Inherited features in compartments]

- `Add existing element (recursive)` behavior has been modified to be more robust and avoid potential exception, mainly the display of nested domain-based edge on State transition view diagram.

== Improvements

- Composite usages are now forbidden inside `PortDefinition`/`PortUsage`.
- Composite usages are now forbidden inside `AttributeDefinition`/`AttributeUsage`.
- Explicit usage of `node` to call SysIDE JavaScript file has been added.

- `Membership`#visibility attribute has been added to `Core` properties in the Details view.

- `Definition`/`Usage` node are now collapsed by default in {gv} & {afv} diagrams.
- `Definition`/`Usage` nodes are expanded in all diagrams when a compartment item is created.
- All elements are now represented with their icon.
- Label is now positioned from inside to outside for `Ports` (Border Nodes).

image::release-notes-port-label.png[Port label]

- {gv} diagrams can now be created on any `Namespace` element.

- Instead of revealing all compartments of a node when user creates a child in one compartment, only the compartment parent of the child to create is revealed.
Other compartments visibility doesn't change.

- It's now possible to create {iv} diagrams on any `Usage`/`Definition` element.
- A new compartment with a free-form layout inside the `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` nodes is now available.
Thanks to this compartment, user can separate `Action` nodes and connect them by using edges.

- Remove button is now available on containment edges.

image::release-notes-delete-containment-edge.png[Remove containment edge]

- `PortUsage` in Interconnection View are now represented with rotative image.
Whatever its border support, the `PortUsage` node is always represented by an arrow pointing inside the parent node.

image::release-notes-rotative-image.png[Rotative image]

- It's now possible to represent and handle `Succession` edges between `Actions` in {gv} diagram, from background diagram but also from action flow compartment.
