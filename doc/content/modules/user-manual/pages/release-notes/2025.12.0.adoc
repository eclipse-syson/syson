= 2025.12.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

== New features

- In diagrams, inherited _PortUsages_ are now displayed as graphical border nodes.
These graphical border nodes cannot be edited or deleted.

- When connecting those inherited _PortUsages_ graphical border nodes to/from another graphical border nodes, the inherited _PortUsages_ are redefined.

- Add a new filter in the explorer to hide expose elements in `ViewUsage`.

- In diagrams, handle `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` parameters (i.e. `ReferenceUsages` elements) as graphical border nodes.
Those parameters can be linked to other parameters using the _New Binding Connector As Usage (bind)_ and _New Flow (flow)_ graphical border node tools.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the `Imports` located in the root `Namespace` were not exported in the textual format.
- Fix an issue where the drag and drop of an `Element` with a _declared short_ name but no _declared name_ from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram was not possible.
For example, the following `Element` can now be safely drag and drop to a diagram:

```
requirement <'SN'> {
    doc /* Some doc */
    comment /* Some comment */
}
```

- Fix an issue where the undo of the deletion of a graphical node in a diagram was not restoring the graphical node correctly.
- Fix an issue where the _eAnnotations_ reference coming from the Ecore metamodel was taking into account by REST APIs serialization.
- In diagrams, fix an issue where the creation of a _Package_ inside another _Package_ created the _Package_ at the root of the diagram in addition to the inside of the target _Package_.
- Fix invalid resolution during textual import of _redefined Feature_ on `Redefinition`.
This problem appears in cases of a name conflict between a global available item and an item accessible via _inherited membership_ such as in the following model:

```
private import ISQBase::mass; // Gives global access to "mass"

#MP part p2 { // Implicit subsetting "p" using a semantic MetadataDefinition
	attribute :>> mass = 2.0; // Should redefine "p::mass" and not "ISQBase::mass"
}

private import Metaobjects::SemanticMetadata;

part p {
	attribute mass;
}

metadata def MP :> SemanticMetadata {
    :>> baseType = p meta SysML::PartUsage;
    :> annotatedElement : SysML::PartUsage;
}
```

- Fix an issue during import and export of rational numbers.
The following model is now properly imported:

```
package Occurrences {
   private import ScalarValues::*;
   occurrence def Occurrence1 {
      attribute f : Real = 1.0;
      attribute g = 3.14;
      attribute h = 2.5E-10;
      attribute i = .5;
      attribute j = 1E+3;
   }
   enum def MyEnum {
      enum1;
   }
}
```

Here is the textual export result:

```
package Occurrences {
   private import ScalarValues::*;
   occurrence def Occurrence1 {
      attribute f : Real = 1.0;
      attribute g = 3.14;
      attribute h = 2.5E-10;
      attribute i = 0.5;
      attribute j = 1000.0;
   }
   enum def MyEnum {
      enum1;
   }
}
```

== Improvements

- In diagrams, when using direct edit on graphical elements, it's now possible to use _short names_ in the qualified names.
If two or more `Elements` share the same _short name_, {product} will search for the best candidate based on the scope of the element.
Furthermore, if an ambiguity exists between the _short name_ and the _declared name_ of two different `Elements`, the declared name will be preferred.

For example in:

```
package Drone {
   package <LA> Drone_LogicalArchitecture {
      part def CommonBattery;
   }
   package <PA> Drone_PhysicalArchitecture {
      part def Battery :> LA::CommonBattery;
   }
}
```

In the example above, when using the direct edit capability to subclass the _Battery_ `Part Definition`, it is now possible to type _LA::CommonBattery_ instead of _Drone_LogicalArchitecture::CommonBattery_.

- The _Explorer_ view now displays the _shortName_ as part of the label of `Elements`.
