== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

== New features

- In diagrams, inherited _PortUsages_ are now displayed as graphical border nodes.
These graphical border nodes cannot be edited or deleted.

- When connecting those inherited _PortUsages_ graphical border nodes to/from another graphical border nodes, the inherited _PortUsages_ are redefined.

- Add a new filter in the _Explorer_ view to hide expose elements in `ViewUsage`.

image::explorer-hide-expose-element-filter.png[Hide expose element filter, width=30%,height=30%]

- In diagrams, handle `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` parameters (i.e. `ReferenceUsages` elements) as graphical border nodes.
Those parameters can be linked to other parameters using the _New Binding Connector As Usage (bind)_ and _New Flow (flow)_ graphical border node tools.

- In diagrams, it is now possible to put an `Element` graphical node inside a new `ViewUsage`, through the _View as >_ contextual menu item on an `Element` graphical node.
This new `ViewUsage` is typed with a standard diagram `ViewDefinition`, one of `General View`, `Interconnection View`, `ActionFlow View` or `StateTransition View`.
The new `ViewUsage` will be displayed in the diagram as a container for the `Element` graphical node.
With this new functionality, it is possible to display some parts of the diagram in a different way, for example an `Interconnection View` inside a `General View` diagram.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the `Imports` located in the root `Namespace` were not exported in the textual format.
- Fix an issue where the drag and drop of an `Element` with a _declared short_ name but no _declared name_ from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram was not possible.
For example, the following `Element` can now be safely drag and drop to a diagram:

```
requirement <'SN'> {
    doc /* Some doc */
    comment /* Some comment */
}
```

- Fix an issue where the undo of the deletion of a graphical node in a diagram was not restoring the graphical node correctly.
- Fix an issue where the _eAnnotations_ reference coming from the Ecore metamodel was taking into account by REST APIs serialization.
- In diagrams, fix an issue where the creation of a _Package_ inside another _Package_ created the _Package_ at the root of the diagram in addition to the inside of the target _Package_.
- Fix invalid resolution during textual import of _redefined Feature_ on `Redefinition`.
This problem appears in cases of a name conflict between a global available item and an item accessible via _inherited membership_ such as in the following model:

```
private import ISQBase::mass; // Gives global access to "mass"

#MP part p2 { // Implicit subsetting "p" using a semantic MetadataDefinition
	attribute :>> mass = 2.0; // Should redefine "p::mass" and not "ISQBase::mass"
}

private import Metaobjects::SemanticMetadata;

part p {
	attribute mass;
}

metadata def MP :> SemanticMetadata {
    :>> baseType = p meta SysML::PartUsage;
    :> annotatedElement : SysML::PartUsage;
}
```

- Fix an issue during textual import and export of rational numbers.

The following model is now properly imported:

```
package Occurrences {
   private import ScalarValues::*;
   occurrence def Occurrence1 {
      attribute f : Real = 1.0;
      attribute g = 3.14;
      attribute h = 2.5E-10;
      attribute i = .5;
      attribute j = 1E+3;
   }
   enum def MyEnum {
      enum1;
   }
}
```

Here is the textual export result:

```
package Occurrences {
   private import ScalarValues::*;
   occurrence def Occurrence1 {
      attribute f : Real = 1.0;
      attribute g = 3.14;
      attribute h = 2.5E-10;
      attribute i = 0.5;
      attribute j = 1000.0;
   }
   enum def MyEnum {
      enum1;
   }
}
```

- Fix an issue where a model with a redefining `AttributeUsage` incorrectly redefined a _short name_ during a textual export.
For example with the following model:

```
part p {
    attribute <a> anAttribute;
}

part p1 :> p {
    attribute :>> anAttribute;
}
```

The export gave :

```
part p {
	attribute <a> anAttribute;
}
part p1 :> p {
	attribute <a> :>> anAttribute;
}
```

Instead, it now exports:

```
part p {
	attribute <a> anAttribute;
}
part p1 :> p {
	attribute :>> anAttribute;
}
```

- Fix the textual export of `UnaryOperator` which are `Expression` using the operators '+', '-', 'not' or '~' with only one parameter.
For example in the following model:

```
private import ScalarValues::*;

part p1 {
    attribute a : Real = -1.0;
    attribute b : Integer = -1;
    attribute c : Integer = +1;
    attribute d : Boolean = not true;
}
```

- Fix an issue during textual export where serializing a reference to an `Element` having only _declared short name_ (but no _declared name_) failed.
The following models is now properly exported:

```
part p1 {
    attribute <a1>;
}

part p2 :> p1 {
    attribute :>> a1; // Previously " attribute :>> ;"
}
```

Note that with this change, _declared short name_ reference will be privileged over _name_ reference when it is possible.
For example, even if "a1" has a proper _declared name_ the model will be exported like this:

```
part p1 {
    attribute <a1> attr1;
}

part p2 :> p1 {
    attribute :>> a1; // And not "attribute :>> attr1;"
}
```

- The published libraries are accessible through the _Libraries_ menu at the top right corner of the application.
On this page, the published libraries' projects are displayed.
You can click on such project to see the content of the published library, in read-only mode.
In those cases, there was an issue that made the _Explorer_ view displays libraries with only `LibraryPackage` top-level element(s) under the `User libraries` directory instead of the root of the _Explorer_ view.
This issue is now fixed.

- In diagrams, fix an issue where the creation of some elements inside a `ViewUsage` graphical node was creating the element at the root of the diagram instead of inside the `ViewUsage` graphical node.
- Fix some errors on validation rules using AQL expressions.
- Fix an error where the creation of a `ViewUsage` from the _Explorer_ view was not typing the `ViewUsage` with the selected `ViewDefinition`.

== Improvements

- In diagrams, when using direct edit on graphical elements, it's now possible to use _short names_ in the qualified names.
If two or more `Elements` share the same _short name_, {product} will search for the best candidate based on the scope of the element.
Furthermore, if an ambiguity exists between the _short name_ and the _declared name_ of two different `Elements`, the declared name will be preferred.

For example in:

```
package Drone {
   package <LA> Drone_LogicalArchitecture {
      part def CommonBattery;
   }
   package <PA> Drone_PhysicalArchitecture {
      part def Battery :> LA::CommonBattery;
   }
}
```

In the example above, when using the direct edit capability to subclass the _Battery_ `Part Definition`, it is now possible to type _LA::CommonBattery_ instead of _Drone_LogicalArchitecture::CommonBattery_.

- The _Explorer_ view now displays the _shortName_ as part of the label of `Elements`.

image::explorer-short-name-label.png[Short name in labels, width=65%,height=65%]

- The textual export now handles the `OperatorExpressions` (mainly used in semantic `MetadataDefinition`) such as in:

```
private import Metaobjects::SemanticMetadata;
part p;
metadata def MD :> SemanticMetadata {
   :>> baseType = p meta SysML::Systems::PartUsage;
}
metadata def MD2 :> SemanticMetadata {
   :>> baseType default = p meta SysML::Systems::PartUsage;
}
```

- The textual import now forces all the _memberFeature_ of _EndFeatureMemberships_ to have _isEnd = true_ like stated in the SysML Specification "8.3.3.3.3 EndFeatureMembership".
For example, it means that the two features used as connector ends in the following models now have _isEnd = true_.

```
package pa1 {
    part pa1;
    part pa2;

    connect pa1 to pa2; // Connector end features pa1 and pa2 now have isEnd = true
}
```

- The textual export now properly exports `ConnectionUsages` such as in the following model.

```
package Parts {
    part <p1> part1 {
        port po1;
    }
    part <p2> part2 {
        port po2;
    }
    part <p3> part3 {
        port po3;
    }
}
package Connections {
    private import Parts::part1;
    private import Parts::part2;
    connect p1 to p2;
    connect [1] p1 to [1] p2;
    connect (p1, p2, Parts::part3);
    connect p1.po1 to p2.po2;
}
package MReqs {
    requirement <Mre1>;
}
package SReqs {
    requirement <Sre1>;
}
package Derivations {
    private import RequirementDerivation::*;
    private import MReqs::*;
    private import SReqs::*;
    #derivation connection {
        end #original ::> Mre1;
        end #derive ::> Sre1;
    }
}
```

- The way the _Explorer_ view displays libraries has been reworked:
* The _Explorer_ view now displays imported-by-reference libraries that only contain top-level `LibraryPackage` elements in the `User libraries` directory.
* Libraries containing at least one top-level `Package` are always displayed at the root of the _Explorer_ view.
* The _Explorer_ view now appends `[read-only]` to read-only models and the `KerML` and `SysML` directories.
* The _Explorer_ view now appends `library-name@library-version` to imported-by-reference library models.

- Extract the frontend extension registry in a separate file and move it from _syson_ to _syson-components_ frontend module in order to be easily used by downstream applications.
