- In diagrams, handle `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` parameters (i.e. `ReferenceUsages` elements) as graphical border nodes.
Those parameters can be linked to other parameters using the _New Binding Connector As Usage (bind)_ and _New Flow (flow)_ graphical border node tools.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the `Imports` located in the root `Namespace` were not exported in the textual format.
- Fix an issue where the drag and drop of an `Element` with a _declared short_ name but no _declared name_ from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram was not possible.
For example, the following `Element` can now be safely drag and drop to a diagram:

```
requirement <'SN'> {
    doc /* Some doc */
    comment /* Some comment */
}
```

- Fix an issue where the undo of the deletion of a graphical node in a diagram was not restoring the graphical node correctly.
- Fix an issue where the _eAnnotations_ reference coming from the Ecore metamodel was taking into account by REST APIs serialization.
