== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where the `Imports` located in the root `Namespace` were not exported in the textual format.
- Fix an issue where the drag and drop of an `Element` with a _declared short_ name but no _declared name_ from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram was not possible.
For example, the following `Element` can now be safely drag and drop to a diagram:

```
requirement <'SN'> {
    doc /* Some doc */
    comment /* Some comment */
}
```
