= 2024.7.0

== Key highlights

- *Expanded Diagram and Model Support*: We've significantly expanded the support for various elements and tools.
- *Increased Stability and Reliability*: We've addressed several key bugs and stability issues including fixing problems with diagrams and import capabilities.
These improvements help keep the integrity and accuracy of semantic data.

== Breaking changes

- Add standard libraries and new models now have a root Namespace to conform with {kerml}/{sysml} specifications.
- Generalization of StateTransition descriptions.
  * Rename `AbstractDiagramDescriptionProvider` `nameGenerator` as `descriptionNameGenerator`. Impacted concrete implementations: `ActionFlowViewDiagramDescriptionProvider`, `GeneralViewDiagramDescriptionProvider`,  `InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDiagramDescriptionProvider`, `InterconnectionViewForUsageDiagramDescriptionProvider`, `StateTransitionViewDiagramDescriptionProvider`.
  * Rename `syson-diagram-statetransition-view` `CompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider` as `StateTransitionActionsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider`.
  * `StateTransitionViewEdgeService` removed, services moved to `ViewEdgeService` and `ViewLabelService`.
  * `StateTransitionActionToolProvider` moved to `syson-diagram-common-view`
  * `StateTransitionCompartmentNodeToolProvider` moved to `syson-diagram-common-view`
  * `createState` and `createOwnedAction` services moved to `ViewToolService`

- Fix an issue where _Allocate_ edges weren't displayed in the Action Flow View diagram.

image::release-notes-afv-allocate.png[Action Flow View - Allocate edges]

- Fix an issue where the computation of _Succession_ was sometimes wrong.
- Fix the owner _Membership_ of dropped elements.

- Fix names used during textual export of _FeatureValue_ elements.
- Fix names used during textual export of _MetadataDefinition_ elements.
- Fix names used during textual export of _FeatureChainExpression_ elements.
- Fix missing parts of _InvocationExpression_ elements during textual export.
- Fix missing element names in the _Expression_ element during textual export.
- Fix an issue where the simple quotes weren't escaped when exporting as textual files.

- Allow the creation of sub-Packages in the model explorer

== Improvements

- Add root _Namespace_ to {product} models and libraries to conform to {sysmlv2} specification.

image::release-notes-root-namespace.png[Root Namespace]

- Improve support for whitespace, quotes, and special characters in direct edit.
- Handle start and done actions in Action Flow View & General View diagrams.
- Add _State_ and _StateDefinition_ in the General View diagram.
- Add _Transition_ source and target to Core properties in the Details view.

image::release-notes-details-view-transition.png[Details View Transition]

- All _redefines_ references of the {sysmlv2} metamodel have been implemented.
- The textual import running process have been improved.
By default, end users don't have to copy _syside-cli.js_ near the _syson-application_ jar anymore.
The embedded _syside-cli.js_ is copied in a system temp folder and executed from there (with node).
But, if you encounter execution rights problem, you can still copy _syside-cli.js_ in a place where you have the appropriate rights and use the _org.eclipse.syson.syside.path_ application option.
- Property "Typed by" is now always visible in the Details view for _Feature_ elements, even if the _Feature_ doesn't have a type yet.

image::release-notes-details-view-typed-by-property.png[Details View Typed by]

- Rename creation tools for Start and Done actions (from Add Start/Done to New Start/Done)
- Reduce the default height of the Package node in diagrams
- Move Feature#direction in Core properties tab of the Details view
- Sort New Object menu entries
- Add Direct Edit tool in _Control_ (_ForkNode_, _JoinNode_...) nodes palettes
- Allow several occurrences of Start and Done actions in actions compartments.
- Rewrite textual import.
It's still an experimental feature but should now be faster and accurate.
- Rewrite the _addExistingElement_ tool.
The tool now works on packages, and doesn't render sibling elements when their semantic element has been rendered by another node (for example in a compartment).
- The empty/null values for _Subsetting_/_Redefinition_/_Subclassification_/_FeatureTyping_ aren't displayed anymore in diagram node labels.
- Add tools for creating Ports with direction
- Add tools for creation Items with direction
- Change the default name of the transition element to _source_to_target_
- Provide new icons for State, Conjugation, Port (in,in/out,out) and Item (in,in/out,out).
- Add tools to create Items and Parts in Port and PortDefinition

image::release-notes-port-item-tool.png[Create Items and Parts in Port and PortDefinition]

- Add tool to create Requirements in RequirementDefinition

image::release-notes-reqdef-req-tool.png[Create Requirements in RequirementDefinition]

- Add tools for creating _Items_ on _ActionDefinition_ in GeneralView and ActionFlowView.
- AcceptAction is now available inside an Action body
- Add private and protected visibility decorators on all elements

== New features

- Add Cypress test infrastructure and run the Cypress tests as part of pull request checks.
- Add integration test infrastructure
- Initial contribution of this documentation
