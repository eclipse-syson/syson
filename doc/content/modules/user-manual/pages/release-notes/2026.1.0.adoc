== Key highlights

== New features

- A new action _Duplicate object_ is available in the _Explorer_ view to duplicate a semantic `Element`.
Note this action is not available for `Relationships`.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that displayed imported libraries at the root of the project if they contained `LibraryPackage` elements and non-`Namespace` elements.
These models are now correctly displayed under the _User libraries_ directory.

== Improvements

- The textual export now properly exports `SatisfyRequirementUsage` such as in the following model:
+
```
package Requirements {
    requirement <Req1> {
        doc /* Some doc */
    }
    requirement def REQ2;
}
part Context1 {
    part 'System 1';
}
package ReqSatisfactions {
    private import Requirements::*;
    assert satisfy Req1 by Context1.'System 1';
    assert satisfy requirement Req2 : REQ2 by Context1.'System 1';
}
```

- In diagrams, a new compartment named _parts_ can be enabled on a `PartUsages` to show nested `PartUsages` as a list:

- The performances of the Visibility menu actions when showing/hiding specific compartments has been improved.
It should particularly be visible on large projects.
