= 2026.1.0

== Key highlights

- *Duplicate object*: a duplicate action is now available in the _Explorer_ view to duplicate semantic `Elements`.
It is also available from the palette to duplicate a graphical node and its semantic `Element`.
- *Connection usages*: in diagrams, a new graphical edge tool is available to create binary `ConnectionUsage` between `Usages`.

== New features

- A new action _Duplicate object_ is available in the _Explorer_ view to duplicate a semantic `Element`.

[NOTE]
====
This action is not available on `Relationships`.

[WARNING]
====
For the moment, only binary `ConnectionUsage` are implemented.

The following structure is not yet handled `connection bus : C connect (d1, d2, d3, d4);`.

== Bug fixes

* In diagrams:

** Fix an issue where the creation of an `Element` inside a `sub-Package` created two graphical nodes instead of one.
** Fix an issue where the creation of an `Element` inside a `sub-Package` could hide unrelated graphical nodes.
** Fix an issue where a new graphical node could be located inside the wrong graphical container.
** Fix an issue where the creation of an `ItemUsage` from an `ActionUsage` or an `ActionDefinition` graphical node was not revealing it.
** Fix an issue where the creation of a `PerformAction` inside a `StateUsage` did not reveal the corresponding compartments in the `StateUsage` graphical node.

* In _Explorer_ view:

** Fix an issue that displayed imported libraries at the root of the project if they contained `LibraryPackage` elements and non-`Namespace` elements.
These models are now correctly displayed under the _User libraries_ directory.

* In textual import/export:

** Fix the textual export of `Elements` with name that conflicts with a SysML keyword.
+
For example, an `AttributeUsage` named "comment" is now properly exported to:
+
```
package Package1 {
	view view1 : StandardViewDefinitions::GeneralView {
		expose part1::'comment';
	}
	part part1 {
		attribute 'comment';
	}
}
```

** Fix the textual export of `FeatureValue` using enumeration value such as in:
+
```
package root {
    enum def Enum1 {
        e1;
        e2;
    }
	part p2 {
		attribute z1 : Enum1 = Enum1::e1; // Previously was attribute z1 : Enum1 = e1;
	}
}
```

** Fix the textual export of `LiteralRational`, where such values were wrongly rounded during textual export.

* Miscellaneous:

** New `Expose` elements now have `visibility` set to _protected_ and have `isImportAll` set to _true_, as required by the SysMLv2 specification.
** Correct the computation of a `Feature`'s types to properly account for subsetted features.
** Fix focus loss on some characters in the _New object from text_ modal.

== Improvements

* In diagrams:

** A new compartment named _parts_ can be enabled on a `PartUsages` to show nested `PartUsages` as a list:
+
image::gv-parts-compartment.png[Parts compartment, width=50%]

** The performances of the _Visibility_ menu action for showing/hiding specific compartments has been improved.
It should particularly be visible on large projects.

** When attempting to create some graphical edges between `Elements` which already have one of the same type, an informative message is displayed instead.
This applies to: `FeatureTyping`, `Subsetting`, `Redefinition` and `Subclassification`.
+
image::release-notes-redundant-feature-typing-message.png[Message displayed when attempting to create a redundant feature typing, width=50%,height=50%]

** It is now possible to create a `SatisfyRequirement` from a `PartDefinition` or `PartUsage` graphical node.
A new compartment named _satisfy requirements_ has also been added to `PartDefinition` and `PartUsage` graphical nodes in diagrams.

** The default graphical node size has been adjusted to avoid word breaks in label names.

** An _items_ compartment is now available on `PortDefinition` graphical nodes to display `ItemUsage`.
** An `ItemUsage` graphical border node is now available on `PortDefinition` graphical nodes.
** When creating an `Element` from a compartment, it will not be displayed by default on the diagram, but only in the compartment.
** A new tool named `Reference Subsetting` is available in the palette to create `ReferenceSubsetting` relationships between `Usage` elements.
** Many new tools now automatically select the `Elements` they create or expose on a diagram.
This makes it easy to start editing newly created elements to give them proper names by starting to type directly when the new element appears.
** An `ItemUsage` graphical border node is now available on `PortUsage` graphical nodes.
** An `ItemUsage` compartment is now available on `PortUsage` graphical nodes to display `ItemUsage`.
** It is now possible to create, edit and see `Documentation` in the _objective_ compartment of `CaseUsage`, `CaseDefinition`, `UseCaseUsage` and `UseCaseDefinition` graphical nodes.
+

** When using _direct edit_ tool on an `AttributeUsage` value, you can more easily use symbols from the `SI` library.
+
For example you had to import the _SI_ library to use _N_ and _m_ symbols like this `attribute t1 = 10.0 [N*m]` or prefix the symbols if the library was not imported like this `t1 = 10.0 [SI::N*SI::m]`.
+
We are now auto importing the library automatically if we detect the use of a symbol from the _SI_ library.
** The _New Subject_ tool now allows to select `Definition` in addition to `Usage`.
+
When a `Definition` is selected, the new subject created (i.e. a `ReferenceUsage`) will be typed by the selected `Definition`.
+
When a `Usage` is selected, the new subject created (i.e. a `ReferenceUsage`) will subset the selected `Usage`.
** The _New Actor_ tool now allows to select `PartDefinition` in addition to `PartUsage`.
+
When a `PartDefinition` is selected, the new actor created (i.e. a `PartUsage`) will be typed by the selected `PartDefinition`.
+
When a `PartUsage` is selected, the new actor created (i.e. a `PartUsage`) will subset the selected `PartUsage`.
** The default size of a _NamespaceImport_ graphical node is now the same as the one for a _Package_.

** In diagrams, when using _direct edit_ tool, you can now set a _multiplicity range_ part (for example [n..n] or [n]) after a _typing_ part, _subsetting_ part or _redefinition_ part, not just before
+
Before, you could only do `part p1[4] :> p2`, `part p6[4] :>> p1` or `part p1[4] : DefA`
+
Now you can also do `part p1 :> p2[4]`, `part p6 :>> p1[4]` or `part p1 : DefA[4]`

** On _General View_ diagrams, it is now possible to create `Comment` graphical nodes from the diagram background.
** On _Interconnection View_ diagrams, the top-level palette (on the diagram's background) no longer proposes to create `Attributes` and `Ports`, which can not actually be displayed on the diagram's background.
** On _Interconnection View_ diagrams, it is now possible to create and see `SatisfyRequirementUsage` graphical nodes in the _interconnection_ compartment.
** On _Interconnection View_ diagrams, a new tool section `Structure` is available on the palette of _interconnection_ compartment, it contains creation tools for all `Elements` that can be created from this compartment, such as `PartUsages` or `ActionUsages`.

* In textual import/export:

** Improve performances of textual export on big SysMLv2 models.
** `ConstraintUsages` are now properly exported in the textual format such as in:
+
```
private import SI::kilogram;
private import ScalarValues::*;
part def P1 {
    attribute x : Real;
}
requirement r1 {
    subject sub : P1;
    attribute actualMass :> ISQBase::mass;
    attribute maxMass :> ISQBase::mass;
    assume constraint NamedRequirementConstraint {    //Here
        actualMass <= maxMass
    }
    assume constraint {        // And here
        sub.x <= 500
    }
    require constraint {       // And here
        actualMass >= 500 [kg]
    }
}
constraint def C;
constraint c : C;
requirement def R1 {
    require constraint c1 :>> c;   // And here
}
```

** The textual export now properly exports `SatisfyRequirementUsage` such as in the following model:
+
```
package Requirements {
    requirement <Req1> {
        doc /* Some doc */
    }
    requirement def REQ2;
}
part Context1 {
    part 'System 1';
}
package ReqSatisfactions {
    private import Requirements::*;
    assert satisfy Req1 by Context1.'System 1';
    assert satisfy requirement Req2 : REQ2 by Context1.'System 1';
}
```

* Miscellaneous:

** The impact analysis dialog now displays changes in a tree.
This dialog provides an overview of the impacts the operation will have on the model (number of elements created, deleted, modified), as well as a tree showing the impacted elements.
+
image::release-notes-library-update-impact-analysis-with-tree.png[Impact analysis with change tree, width=65%,height=65%]

** In the _Advanced_ tab of the _Details_ view, _isComposite_ and _isReference_ properties (checkbox widgets) now have a help text.
