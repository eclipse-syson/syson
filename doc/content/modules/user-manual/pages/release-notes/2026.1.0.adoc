= 2026.1.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

== New features

- A new action _Duplicate object_ is available in the _Explorer_ view to duplicate a semantic `Element`.
Note this action is not available for `Relationships`.

image::explorer-duplicate-object-dialog.png[Duplicate Object dialog, width=25%,height=25%]

- A new tool section `Structure` is available on the palette of an interconnection node, it contains creation tools for `Part` and `Action`.
- A new tool is available in the _General View_ palette to duplicate a node and its semantic `Element`.

- `RequirementConstraintMembership` are now properly exported in the textual format such as in:

```
private import SI::kilogram;
private import ScalarValues::*;
part def P1 {
    attribute x : Real;
}
requirement r1 {
    subject sub : P1;
    attribute actualMass :> ISQBase::mass;
    attribute maxMass :> ISQBase::mass;
    assume constraint NamedRequirementConstraint { //Here
        actualMass <= maxMass
    }
    assume constraint { // And here
        sub.x <= 500
    }
    require constraint { // And here
        actualMass >= 500 [kg]
    }
}
constraint def C;
constraint c : C;
requirement def R1 {
    require constraint c1 :>> c; // And here
}
```

- In diagrams, a new graphical edge tool is available to create binary `ConnectionUsage` between `Usages`.

[WARNING]
====
For the moment, only binary `ConnectionUsage` are implemented.

The following structure is not yet handled `connection bus : C connect (d1, d2, d3, d4);`.
====

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that displayed imported libraries at the root of the project if they contained `LibraryPackage` elements and non-`Namespace` elements.
These models are now correctly displayed under the _User libraries_ directory.
- Fix an issue where, in the diagrams, the creation of an `Element` inside a `sub-Package` created two graphical nodes instead of one.
- New `Expose` elements now have `visibility` set to _protected_ and have `isImportAll` set to _true_, as required by the SysMLv2 specification.

== Improvements

- The textual export now properly exports `SatisfyRequirementUsage` such as in the following model:
+
```
package Requirements {
    requirement <Req1> {
        doc /* Some doc */
    }
    requirement def REQ2;
}
part Context1 {
    part 'System 1';
}
package ReqSatisfactions {
    private import Requirements::*;
    assert satisfy Req1 by Context1.'System 1';
    assert satisfy requirement Req2 : REQ2 by Context1.'System 1';
}
```

- In diagrams, a new compartment named _parts_ can be enabled on a `PartUsages` to show nested `PartUsages` as a list:

- The performances of the Visibility menu actions when showing/hiding specific compartments has been improved.
It should particularly be visible on large projects.
- The impact analysis dialog now displays changes in a tree.
This dialog provides an overview of the impacts the operation will have on the model (number of elements created, deleted, modified), as well as a tree showing the impacted elements.

- In diagrams, when attempting to create some graphical edges between `Elements` which already have one of the same type, an informative message is displayed instead.
This applies to: `FeatureTyping`, `Subsetting`, `Redefinition` and `Subclassification`.

- In diagrams, it is now possible to create a `SatisfyRequirement` from a `PartDefinition` or `PartUsage` graphical node.
A new compartment named _satisfy requirements_ has also been added to `PartDefinition` and `PartUsage` graphical nodes in diagrams.

- In diagrams, the default graphical node size has been adjusted to avoid word breaks in label names.

- In diagrams, an _items_ compartment is now available on `PortDefinition` graphical nodes to display `ItemUsage`.
- In diagrams, an `ItemUsage` graphical border node is now available on `PortDefinition` graphical nodes.
- In diagrams, when creating an element from a compartment, it will not be displayed by default on the diagram, but only in the compartment.
- In the _Advanced_ tab of the _Details_ view, _isComposite_ and _isReference_ properties (checkbox widgets) now have a help text.
- In diagrams, a new tool named `Reference Subsetting` is available in the palette to create `ReferenceSubsetting` relationships between `Usage` elements.
- In diagrams, many new tools now automatically select the `Elements` they create or expose on a diagram.
This makes it easy to start editing newly created elements to give them proper names by starting to type directly when the new element appears.
