= 2026.1.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

== New features

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that displayed imported libraries at the root of the project if they contained `LibraryPackage` elements and non-`Namespace` elements.
These models are now correctly displayed under the _User libraries_ directory.

== Improvements

- The textual export now properly exports `SatisfyRequirementUsage` such as in the following model.

```
package Requirements {
    requirement <Req1> {
        doc /* Some doc */
    }
    requirement def REQ2;
}
part Context1 {
    part 'System 1';
}
package ReqSatisfactions {
    private import Requirements::*;
    assert satisfy Req1 by Context1.'System 1';
    assert satisfy requirement Req2 : REQ2 by Context1.'System 1';
}
```
