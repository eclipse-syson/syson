= 2025.8.0

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to {sysmlv2} 2025-04 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to {sysmlv2} and {kerml} 2025-04 specifications released on April 2025 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).
All existing models/projects in {product} will be automatically migrated to this new version.
**In any case, download all your existing models/projects and back up your database before upgrading to 2025.8.0 (as always).**


== Breaking changes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view
* `ISysONExplorerFragment` implementations now need to implement `getKind()` and `getParent()`.
* The constructors of `KerMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, `LibrariesDirectory`, `SysMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, and `UserLibrariesDirectory` now have a new `parent` parameter.
* `ISysONExplorerService` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`
* `ISysONExplorerServiceDelegate` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`
- To facilitate the creation of projects on top of SysON, it's no longer necessary to declare the following files (you just need to re-use them):
* SysONDocumentTreeItemContextMenuContribution
* SysONExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy
* SysONObjectTreeItemContextMenuContribution

== New features

- Add a new edge tool from `UseCaseUsage` to create `IncludeUseCaseUsage` in the _General view_ diagram.
image::gv-IncludeUseCaseUsage.png[Manage Visibility modal, width=65%,height=65%]
- Implement the textual export of `FlowUsage`.
The following model now properly exports the `FlowUsage` elements.

```
part def P1Def {
    port po1 : PortDef1;
}
port def PortDef1 {
    out item item1 : P2Def;
}
part def P2Def;
part def P3Def {
    in item item2 : P3Def;
}
part p1 {
    part p2 : P1Def;
    part p3 : P3Def;
    flow from p2.po1.item1 to p3.item2;
    flow f1 from p2.po1.item1 to p3.item2;
}
```

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view.
- Fix an issue where a drag-and-drop of an `Element` from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram exposed the `Element` twice in the `ViewUsage` associated to the diagram.
- In the _General View_ diagram, the creation of `BindingConnectorAsUsage` now computes the shortest feature path between the source feature and the target feature to create a feature chain if required.
For example creating a `BindingConnectorAsUsage` between "i0" and "i11" in the following model will create the feature chain: _a1.a11.i11_.

```
action a0 {
    item i0;
    action a1 {
        action a11 {
            in item i11;
        }
    }
}
```

Moreover, the tooling has been improved to:
* Find the best containment location at creation time. In this case, "a0"
* Properly handle source/target reconnection to recompute the feature chain and the best container.
- Fix an issue where models and diagrams referencing standard library elements might not be correctly loaded.
- Fix an issue where models and diagrams referencing standard library elements might not be correctly saved.

-  Fix an issue where the type property of `Feature` that owns `FeatureChaining` was not correctly set.
The type of the last `FeatureChaining` is now added to the list of types of the owning feature.

For example in:

```
Type T1 {
    feature t1Feature : T2;
}
Type T2 {
    feature t2Feature : T3;
}
Type T3 {
    feature t3Feature ;
}
```

The `FeatureChain` _t1Feature.t2Feature_ is now typed with _T3_.

- Fix an issue with name resolution during the textual import of elements used in a `FlowConnectionAsUsage`.
In the following example, the last segment of the `FlowConnectionAsUsage` ends were not properly resolved during import:

```
package 'Port Example' {
    attribute def Temp;
    part def Fuel;
    port def FuelOutPort {
        attribute temperature : Temp;
        out item fuelSupply : Fuel;
        in item fuelReturn : Fuel;
    }
    port def FuelInPort {
        attribute temperature : Temp;
        in item fuelSupply : Fuel;
        out item fuelReturn : Fuel;
    }
    part def FuelTankAssembly {
        port fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;
    }
    part def Engine {
        port engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;
    }
}
package 'Flow Connection Interface Example' {
    private import 'Port Example'::*;
    part def Vehicle;
    part vehicle : Vehicle {
        part tankAssembly : FuelTankAssembly;
        part eng : Engine;
        flow of Fuel
            from tankAssembly.fuelTankPort.fuelSupply // Failed to resolve fuelSupply
            to eng.engineFuelPort.fuelSupply; // Failed to resolve fuelSupply
        flow of Fuel
            from eng.engineFuelPort.fuelReturn // Failed to resolve fuelReturn
            to tankAssembly.fuelTankPort.fuelReturn; // Failed to resolve fuelReturn
    }
}
```

- Fix textual import issues when importing `MetadataUsage`.
The following notations, used to define `MetadataUsage`, are now properly imported by SysON:

```
package p1 {
    metadata def MD1 {
        attribute x : ScalarValues::String;
    }
    metadata def MD2 {
        attribute y : ScalarValues::String;
        :> annotatedElement : SysML::PartUsage;
    }

    #MD1 part p1; // User Defined Keyword
    part p2 {
        @MD1 { // Nested Annotation
            x = "1";
    }
    }
    part p3;
    metadata MD1 about p3; // KerML Style
    part p4;
    metadata m1 : MD1 about p4; // Named annotation

    #MD2 part p5;
}
```

- In the _Explorer_ view, fix an issue where the context menu of a tree item was loaded twice.
- In diagrams, fix an issue where the `Actors` were not shown anymore in the _actors_ compartment.
- For all REST APIs, fix an issue where string values were used instead of literal values for primitive types when serializing with JSON.

All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the {sysmlv2} 2025-04 specification.
All validation rules have been updated to comply with the {sysmlv2} 2025-04 specification.

- Exclude referenced libraries from validation.
Referenced libraries are not validated anymore since users can't fix them in their project.
It is the responsibility of the library owner to fix the validation issues in the project that contains the library.
- For all REST APIs, ensure that the `@id` and `elementId` attributes have the same value (the `elementId` value) in JSON serialization.
The SysMLv2 standard has not decided if those two attributes should be the same or not.
This change is made to ease the use of the REST APIs and to avoid confusion.
- For all REST APIs, use alphabetical order for the JSON serialization of attributes and references.
