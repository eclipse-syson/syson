= 2025.8.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view
* `ISysONExplorerFragment` implementations now need to implement `getKind()` and `getParent()`.
* The constructors of `KerMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, `LibrariesDirectory`, `SysMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, and `UserLibrariesDirectory` now have a new `parent` parameter.
* `ISysONExplorerService` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`
* `ISysONExplorerServiceDelegate` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`

== New features

- Add a new edge tool from `UseCaseUsage` to create `IncludeUseCaseUsage` in the _General view_ diagram.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view.
- Fix an issue where a d'n'd of an `Element` from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram exposed the `Element` twice in the `ViewUsage` associated to the diagram.
- In the _General View_ diagram, the creation of `BindingConnectorAsUsage` now computes the shortest feature path between the source feature and the target feature to create a feature chain if required.
For example creating a `BindingConnectorAsUsage` between "i0" and "i11" in the following model will create the feature chain : _a1.a11.i11_.

```
action a0 {
    item i0;
    action a1 {
        action a11 {
            in item i11;
        }
    }
}
```

Moreover, the tooling has been improved to:
* Find the best containment location at creation time. In this case, "a0"
* Handle properly source/target reconnection to recompute feature chain and the best container.
- Fix an issue where model and diagrams referencing standard libraries elements might not correctly loaded.
