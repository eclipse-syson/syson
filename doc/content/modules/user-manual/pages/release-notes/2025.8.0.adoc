= 2025.8.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

- *Model conformance to {sysmlv2} 2025-04 version*: the metamodel has been modified to conform to {sysmlv2} and {kerml} 2025-04 specifications released on April 2025 (see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details).
All existing models/projects in {product} will be automatically migrated to this new version.
**In any case, download all your existing models/projects before upgrading to 2025.8.0 (as always).**


== Breaking changes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view
* `ISysONExplorerFragment` implementations now need to implement `getKind()` and `getParent()`.
* The constructors of `KerMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, `LibrariesDirectory`, `SysMLStandardLibraryDirectory`, and `UserLibrariesDirectory` now have a new `parent` parameter.
* `ISysONExplorerService` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`
* `ISysONExplorerServiceDelegate` implementations now need to implement `canExpandAll(TreeItem, IEditingContext)`
- To facilitate the creation of projects on top of SysON, it's no longer necessary to declare the following files (you just need to re-use them):
* SysONDocumentTreeItemContextMenuContribution
* SysONExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy
* SysONObjectTreeItemContextMenuContribution

== New features

- Add a new edge tool from `UseCaseUsage` to create `IncludeUseCaseUsage` in the _General view_ diagram.
image::gv-IncludeUseCaseUsage.png[Manage Visibility modal, width=65%,height=65%]
- Implement the textual export of `FlowUsage`.
The following model now properly export the `FlowUsage` elements.

```
part def P1Def {
    port po1 : PortDef1;
}
port def PortDef1 {
    out item item1 : P2Def;
}
part def P2Def;
part def P3Def {
    in item item2 : P3Def;
}
part p1 {
    part p2 : P1Def;
    part p3 : P3Def;
    flow from p2.po1.item1 to p3.item2;
    flow f1 from p2.po1.item1 to p3.item2;
}
```

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that made the _Expand All_ tool not work consistently in SysON _Explorer_ view.
- Fix an issue where a d'n'd of an `Element` from the _Explorer_ view to a diagram exposed the `Element` twice in the `ViewUsage` associated to the diagram.
- In the _General View_ diagram, the creation of `BindingConnectorAsUsage` now computes the shortest feature path between the source feature and the target feature to create a feature chain if required.
For example creating a `BindingConnectorAsUsage` between "i0" and "i11" in the following model will create the feature chain : _a1.a11.i11_.

```
action a0 {
    item i0;
    action a1 {
        action a11 {
            in item i11;
        }
    }
}
```

Moreover, the tooling has been improved to:
* Find the best containment location at creation time. In this case, "a0"
* Handle properly source/target reconnection to recompute feature chain and the best container.
- Fix an issue where model and diagrams referencing standard libraries elements might not correctly loaded.
- Fix an issue where model and diagrams referencing standard libraries elements might not correctly saved.

-  Fix an issue where the type property of `Feature` that owns `FeatureChaining` was not correctly set.
The type of the last `FeatureChaining` is now added to the list of type of the owning feature.

For example in:

```
Type T1 {
    feature t1Feature : T2;
}
Type T2 {
    feature t2Feature : T3;
}
Type T3 {
    feature t3Feature ;
}
```

The `FeatureChain` _t1Feature.t2Feature_ is now typed with _T3_.

- Fix a name resolution problem during textual import of elements used in a `FlowConnectionAsUsage`.
In the following example, the last segment of the `FlowConnectionAsUsage` ends were not propertly resolved during import.

```
package 'Port Example' {
    attribute def Temp;
    part def Fuel;
    port def FuelOutPort {
        attribute temperature : Temp;
        out item fuelSupply : Fuel;
        in item fuelReturn : Fuel;
    }
    port def FuelInPort {
        attribute temperature : Temp;
        in item fuelSupply : Fuel;
        out item fuelReturn : Fuel;
    }
    part def FuelTankAssembly {
        port fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort;
    }
    part def Engine {
        port engineFuelPort : FuelInPort;
    }
}
package 'Flow Connection Interface Example' {
    private import 'Port Example'::*;
    part def Vehicle;
    part vehicle : Vehicle {
        part tankAssy : FuelTankAssembly;
        part eng : Engine;
        flow of Fuel
            from tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelSupply // Failed to resolved fuelSupply
            to eng.engineFuelPort.fuelSupply; // Failed to resolved fuelSupply
        flow of Fuel
            from eng.engineFuelPort.fuelReturn // Failed to resolved fuelReturn
            to tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelReturn; // Failed to resolved fuelReturn
    }
}
```
