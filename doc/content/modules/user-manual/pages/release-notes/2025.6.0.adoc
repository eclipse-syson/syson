= 2025.6.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights


== Breaking changes

- Editing the label of a `TransitionUsage` directly from the diagram is no longer supported.
The label aggregates multiple complex elements, including:

* **Accepter**
* **Payload**
* **Receiver**
* **Guard**
* **Effect**

The current editing infrastructure is not sufficiently robust to manage all of these components reliably.
To prevent potential loss or corruption of data during editing, this functionality has been disabled.
Future contributions are planned to introduce enhanced capabilities for editing these properties directly within the diagram.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that made published libraries' dependencies always empty.
Publishing a project with a dependency to a library now correctly produces a library with the same dependency.
- In the _Details_ view, fix an issue that prevents adding a new value to a multi-valued reference on a reference widget.
- In _General View_ diagram, fix an issue where _New Binding Connector As Usage (bind)_ tool accessible on `ItemUsage` bordered nodes was failing to create graphical edge between `ItemUsage` bordered nodes.

image::BindingConnectorAsUsageOnItemUsage.png[BindingConnectorAsUsage between two ItemUsages]

- In all diagrams, fix an issue where some compartments (containing the new element created) were not revealed when the _New Perform Action_ tool was executed.
- In all diagrams, fix an issue where the execution of _Add existing elements_ tool adding `Succession` with guard involving 'start' or 'done' were not well displayed.
If a _start_ or _done_ `ActionUsage` is used by an owned `TransitionUsage` they are now added to the _Action Flow_ compartment.
- In all diagrams, fix an issue of `TransitionUsage` were displayed twice if the _source_ or _target_ of the `TransitionUsage` was displayed multiple times in the same diagram.
- In all diagrams, fix an issue where the children of the `Package` graphical node lost their position when diagram is rendered after tab switching.
- In all diagrams, fix wrong tool section name found in some compartments' palette.
- In all diagrams, fix the name of the `Constraint` creation tools inside `Requirements`.
They are now named:

* `New Require constraint`
* `New Assume constraint`

- In the _Details_ view, fix an issue that prevents opening the candidates on a reference widget.
- Fix an issue in the textual import of `MultiplicityRange` with explicit lower and upper bounds.
The textual import now correctly creates a `MultiplicityRange` containing `LiteralInteger` elements for integer bounds, and `FeatureReferenceExpression` elements for feature bounds.
- Fix an issue where dragging and dropping a `Definition` element from the _Explorer view_ on a _General View_ did not create the associated node.

- In diagrams, prevent `TransitionUsage` graphical edges to be reconnected to another `TransitionUsage`.
In the previous implementation, it was possible during a graphical edge reconnection to drop the source or target to another `TransitionUsage`.
The semantic of the `TransitionUsage` being reconnected was changed and the graphical edge was removed from the diagram.

== New features

- `ViewUsage` may now be displayed and created from the _General View_.

image::view-usage-nodes.png[ViewUsage nodes, width=65%,height=65%]

- `ViewUsage` may now display graphical contents in _General View_ diagram.

image::view-usage-graphical-contents.png[ViewUsage graphical contents, width=65%,height=65%]

- `ManageVisibility` node action may now be displayed from the _General View_ on `Definition` and `Usage`  graphical nodes.
This node action open a modal that can be used to reveal or hide the graphical node children's.
Menu actions can be used to `reveal all content`, `reveal valued content only` or `hide all content`.

image::release-notes-manage-visibility.png[Manage Visibility modal, width=65%,height=65%]

== Improvements

- In _General View_ diagram, `ConnectionDefinition` are now also represented as graphical elements:

image::connection-definition-nodes.png[Connection Definition graphical elements, width=60%,height=60%]

- New tool `New Exhibit State with referenced State` has been added to the palette of the `Part Usage` (inside the `Behavior` section).
This tool allows to create a new `Exhibit State` element referencing an existing `State Usage` selected using a dedicated selection dialog.

- Implement textual export of `ForkNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
action action2 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1 {
        /* doc1 */
    }
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `JoinNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    join join1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then join1;
    first a2 then join1;
    then done;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `MergeNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    merge merge1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then merge1;
    first a2 then merge1;
}
```

- Add `ItemUsage` as _bordered nodes_ on `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` in the _General View_ diagram.

image::ItemParameters.png[ItemUsage on ActionUsage and ActionUsage]

- Add `FlowConnectionUsage` from `ItemUsage` on _General View_ Diagram.

image::FlowConnectionUsageOnItems.png[FlowConnectionUsage on ItemUsages]

- Implement textual import/export of `AcceptActionUsage` such as in the following model:

```
action a1 {
    item def S1;
    item def S2;
    item def S3;
    port p1;
    port p2;
    port p3;
    action a1 accept s1 : S1 via p1;
    action a2 accept S2 via p2;
    accept S3 via p3;
}
```

- When end-users click on _New Object_ on a semantic element, and select a `ViewUsage`, then a `ViewUsage` typed by default with the _General View_ `ViewDefinition` from the standard library will be created.
A _General View_ diagram will also be created and associated to the `ViewUsage`.
- Create `ViewUsage` semantic element in addition to _Diagram_ on _New representation_ menu in _Explorer_ view.
All existing SysON _DiagramDescriptions_ (i.g. _General View_, _Interconnection View_...) have been updated to reflect the fact that they now be associated to `ViewUsages`.

- Implement textual export of `TriggerInvocationExpression` such as in the following `TransitionUsage` using as a trigger a `TriggerInvocationExpression`:

```
part part1 {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    action b {
        attribute f : Boolean;
    }
    action a1 {
        accept when b.f; // <- AcceptActionUsage using a TriggerInvocationExpression : when b.f
    }
}
```
- New tools have been introduced in `Behavior` section of `State` elements (Usage and Definition) to create state sub actions (`Entry`, `Do`, and `Exit`) referencing an existing `ActionUsage`.
Existing tools `New Entry Action`, `New Do Action` and `New Exit Action` have been updated to be aligned with SysMLV2 specification.

- In the _General View_ diagram, improve the label of `TransitionUsage` in order to be able to display the _accepter information.
For example for :

```
item def TurnOn;
state def OnOff2 {
    private import SI::*;
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    port commPort;
    attribute x : Real;
    state off;
    state on;
    state idle;
    transition off_on
    	first off
    	accept TurnOn via commPort
    	then on;
    transition on_off
    	first on
    	accept after 5 [min]
    	then off;
    transition on_idle
    	first on
    	if x > 0.0
    	then idle;
}
```

The _General View_ diagram will display `TransitionUsage` as:

image::StateTransitionUsageLabels.png[TransitionUsage labels]

- Add a `parameters` compartment on `ActionDefinition` in the _General View_ diagram, to display directed features.

image::release-notes-GV-actionDefinition-parameters.png[Parameters compartment on ActionDefinition]

- In the _General View_ diagram, the selection dialog to reference an existing `Action` when creating a new `Perform Action` has been improved to present those `Actions` in a hierarchical way.
- Make LibraryPackage's `isStandard` checkbox read-only in the details view.
At the moment SysON only supports KerML and SysML, and does not support the definition of other normative model libraries.
- Improve _New objects from text_ action in order to be able to resolve names against existing elements.
For example, in the following context:

```
action def ActionDefinition1 {
			action action1 {
				out item item1Out;
			}
			action action2 {
				in item item1In;
			}
		}
```

Using _New objects from text_ from _ActionDefinition1_ with the following content `flow action1.item1Out to action2.item1In;`, will properly resolve the end features of the created `FlowConnectionUsage`.

- Add a `perform actions` compartment `PartUsage` and `PartDefinition` to display `PerformActionUsage` in the _General View_ diagram.

image::gv-parts-perform-actions-compartment.png[perform actions compartment in parts, width=70%, align="center"]

- New compartment in `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` to display `PerformActionUsage` in the General view diagram.

image::gv-actions-perform-actions-compartment.png[perform actions compartment in parts, width=70%, align="center"]

- In all diagrams, the initial `Package` graphical node width has been reduced of 1/3 to be more compact.

.Before
image::package-node-width-before.png[Package node before change, width=400]

.After
image::package-node-width-after.png[Package node after change, width=300]

- Improve the time required to display the available commands in the omnibox.

- In the _General View_ diagram, _state transition_ compartment is now available on :

* `StateUsage`
* `StateDefinition`
* `ExhibitStateUsage`

image:StateTransitionsCmpOnStates.png[State Transition Compartment on StateUsage, StateDefintion and ExhibitStateUsage]

- The `ViewUsage#exposedElement` feature is now updated to reflect the contents of the diagram (_General View_, _Interconnection View_, _Action Flow View_...) on which it is associated.
- Make file extension check case-insensitive on textual import (i.e. allows to import .SYSML, .SysML, .KERML...)
- Make the _Details_ view more extensible in how it determines whether a SysML _Element_ is editable or not.
Also improve the kind of elements for which SysON is able to determine whether they are editable or not.
- In diagrams, improve _direct edit_ tool on `ConstraintUsage` to be able to edit basic expressions.
It is now possible to use the following type of expressions in a `ConstraintUsage:

* `BinaryOperatorExpression`
* `BracketExpression`
* `FeatureChainExpression`

For example:

```
requirement weight{
    attribute actualWeight :> ISQ::mass;
    require constraint {actualWeight <= 0.25 [lb]}
}
```

- In diagrams, improve _direct edit_ tool on `Feature` such as `AttributeUsage` or `ItemUsage` to be able to edit `FeatureValue` with basic expressions.
It is now possible to use the following type of expressions in a `Feature`:

* `BinaryOperatorExpression`
* `BracketExpression`
* `FeatureChainExpression`

Here are some examples:

```
package P0 {
    part p1 {
            attribute x1 =  x3 - x2 - 4.5; // Nested BinaryOperatorExpression
            attribute x2 = 25 [SI::kg] + 15 [SI::kg]; // BracketExpression
            attribute x3;
    }
    item def I2 {
        in item i2_1 : I3;
    }

    item def I3 {
        in item i3_1;
    }
}
...
action a1 {
    in item a1_3 : P0::I2;
}

action a2 {
    in item a2_1 = a1.a1_3.i2_1.i3_1; // FeatureChainExpression
}
```

- Implement textual export of `ViewUsage` such as:

```
view rearAxleAssemblyDiagram {
    expose rearAxleAssembly;
    expose rearAxleAssembly::rearAxle;
    expose rearAxleAssembly::differential;
    render asTreeDiagram;
}
```
