- In _General View_ diagram, `ConnectionDefinition` are now also represented as graphical elements:

image::connection-definition-nodes.png[Connection Definition graphical elements, width=60%,height=60%]

- New tool `New Exhibit State with referenced State` has been added to the palette of the `Part Usage` (inside the `Behavior` section).
This tool allows to create a new `Exhibit State` element referencing an existing `State Usage` selected using a dedicated selection dialog.

- Implement textual export of `ForkNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
action action2 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1 {
        /* doc1 */
    }
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `JoinNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    join join1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then join1;
    first a2 then join1;
    then done;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `MergeNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    merge merge1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then merge1;
    first a2 then merge1;
}
```

- Add `ItemUsage` as _bordered nodes_ on `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` in the _General View_ diagram.

- Add `FlowConnectionUsage` from `ItemUsage` on _General View_ Diagram.

- Implement textual import/export of `AcceptActionUsage` such as in the following model:

```
action a1 {
    item def S1;
    item def S2;
    item def S3;
    port p1;
    port p2;
    port p3;
    action a1 accept s1 : S1 via p1;
    action a2 accept S2 via p2;
    accept S3 via p3;
}
```

- Type new `ViewUsage` from _Explorer_ view with _General View_ `ViewDefinition`.
When end-users click on _New Object_ on a semantic element, and select a `ViewUsage`, then a `ViewUsage` typed by default with the _General View_ `ViewDefinition` from the standard library will be created.

- Implement textual export of `TriggerInvocationExpression` such as in the following `TransitionUsage` using as a trigger a `TriggerInvocationExpression`:

```
part part1 {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    action b {
        attribute f : Boolean;
    }
    action a1 {
        accept when b.f; // <- AcceptActionUsage using a TriggerInvocationExpression : when b.f
    }
}
```
- New tools have been introduced in `Behavior` section of State elements (Usage and Definition) to create state sub actions (`Entry`, `Do`, and `Exit`) referencing an existing `ActionUsage`.
Existing tools `New Entry Action`, `New Do Action` and `New Exit Action` have been updated to be aligned with SysMLV2 specification.
