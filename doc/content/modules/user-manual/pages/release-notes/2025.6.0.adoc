= 2025.6.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights


== Breaking changes

- Editing the label of a `TransitionUsage` directly from the diagram is no longer supported.
The label aggregates multiple complex elements, including:

* **Accepter**
* **Payload**
* **Receiver**
* **Guard**
* **Effect**

The current editing infrastructure is not sufficiently robust to manage all of these components reliably.
To prevent potential loss or corruption of data during editing, this functionality has been disabled.
Future contributions are planned to introduce enhanced capabilities for editing these properties directly within the diagram.

== Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that made published libraries' dependencies always empty.
Publishing a project with a dependency to a library now correctly produces a library with the same dependency.


== New features

- `ViewUsage` may now be displayed and created from the _General View_.

== Improvements

- In _General View_ diagram, `ConnectionDefinition` are now also represented as graphical elements:

image::connection-definition-nodes.png[Connection Definition graphical elements, width=60%,height=60%]

- New tool `New Exhibit State with referenced State` has been added to the palette of the `Part Usage` (inside the `Behavior` section).
This tool allows to create a new `Exhibit State` element referencing an existing `State Usage` selected using a dedicated selection dialog.

- Implement textual export of `ForkNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
action action2 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1 {
        /* doc1 */
    }
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `JoinNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    join join1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then join1;
    first a2 then join1;
    then done;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `MergeNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    merge merge1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then merge1;
    first a2 then merge1;
}
```

- Add `ItemUsage` as _bordered nodes_ on `ActionUsage` and `ActionDefinition` in the _General View_ diagram.

- Add `FlowConnectionUsage` from `ItemUsage` on _General View_ Diagram.

- Implement textual import/export of `AcceptActionUsage` such as in the following model:

```
action a1 {
    item def S1;
    item def S2;
    item def S3;
    port p1;
    port p2;
    port p3;
    action a1 accept s1 : S1 via p1;
    action a2 accept S2 via p2;
    accept S3 via p3;
}
```

- Type new `ViewUsage` from _Explorer_ view with _General View_ `ViewDefinition`.
When end-users click on _New Object_ on a semantic element, and select a `ViewUsage`, then a `ViewUsage` typed by default with the _General View_ `ViewDefinition` from the standard library will be created.

- Implement textual export of `TriggerInvocationExpression` such as in the following `TransitionUsage` using as a trigger a `TriggerInvocationExpression`:

```
part part1 {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    action b {
        attribute f : Boolean;
    }
    action a1 {
        accept when b.f; // <- AcceptActionUsage using a TriggerInvocationExpression : when b.f
    }
}
```
- New tools have been introduced in `Behavior` section of State elements (Usage and Definition) to create state sub actions (`Entry`, `Do`, and `Exit`) referencing an existing `ActionUsage`.
Existing tools `New Entry Action`, `New Do Action` and `New Exit Action` have been updated to be aligned with SysMLV2 specification.

- In _General View_ diagram, improve the label of `TransitionUsage` in order to be able to display the _accepter information.
For example for :

```
item def TurnOn;
state def OnOff2 {
    private import SI::*;
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    port commPort;
    attribute x : Real;
    state off;
    state on;
    state idle;
    transition off_on
    	first off
    	accept TurnOn via commPort
    	then on;
    transition on_off
    	first on
    	accept after 5 [min]
    	then off;
    transition on_idle
    	first on
    	if x > 0.0
    	then idle;
}
```

The _General View_ diagram will display `TransitionUsage` as:

image::StateTransitionUsageLabels.png[TransitionUsage labels]

- Add a `parameters` compartment on `ActionDefinition` in the _General View_ diagram, to display directed features.
