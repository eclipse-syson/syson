- New tool `New Exhibit State with referenced State` has been added to the palette of the `Part Usage` (inside the `Behavior` section).
This tool allows to create a new `Exhibit State` element referencing an existing `State Usage` selected using a dedicated selection dialog.

- Implement textual export of `ForkNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
action action2 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1 {
        /* doc1 */
    }
    then a1;
    then a2;
    first start then fork1;
}
```

- Implement textual export of `JoinNode` such as:

```
action action1 {
    action a1;
    action a2;
    fork fork1;
    then a1;
    then a2;
    join join1;
    first start then fork1;
    first a1 then join1;
    first a2 then join1;
    then done;
}
```
