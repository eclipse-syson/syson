= Key concepts and terminology

Read this to get a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental principles that shape the capability of {product} offering essential insights into its core foundations.

== Project

In {product}, a *Project* serves as a high-level container that organizes <<Model,models>>.
You can use projects to group models, providing a structured and efficient way to manage your content.

[NOTE]
====
It's important to note that creating sub-projects within a project isn't supported.
====

[NOTE]
====
All models exist at the same level within a project.
====

This design ensures simplicity and clarity in organizing and accessing your models, fostering a straightforward and intuitive project management experience.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product}, projects are _public_.
Public projects are visible by everyone.

== Model

In {product}, a model represents a comprehensive and structured representation of a system, capturing its various aspects, components, and relationships.
These models serve as fundamental building blocks for organizing and articulating the design, behavior, and structure of a system.
Notably, all models within {product} adhere to the {sysmlv2} language metamodel, ensuring compliance with standardized specifications.
This adherence to the {sysmlv2} metamodel enhances interoperability, consistency, and compatibility across the modeling landscape, making models integral components for effective system engineering and collaborative project development.

== Representation

In the context of {product}, a representation serves as a visual depiction or interpretation of a system, capturing specific aspects and viewpoints.
Essentially, it's one of the possible views within the {sysmlv2} framework.
Representations offer a means to illustrate and communicate diverse facets of a system, aiding in the comprehensive understanding of its structure, behavior, and relationships.
These visual depictions play a pivotal role in model-based systems engineering, offering a nuanced and graphical approach to convey complex information in a more visible manner.
Each representation within {sysmlv2} contributes to building a holistic understanding of a system's architecture and design.

== Library

In {product}, a *Library* is a read-only snapshot of a project that may be referenced by other projects or libraries.

Published libraries have a _namespace_, _version_ and _description_.
Once a library has been published, it cannot be unpublished.
It is also not possible to overwrite an existing library.
Several libraries may have the same name (and version) provided they are from different namespaces.

The list of published libraries in {product} is available at `<baseUrl>/libraries/`.
This page is also accessible from the 'help' menu in the top right corner of the application.
