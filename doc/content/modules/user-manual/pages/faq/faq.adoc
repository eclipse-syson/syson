.*What's {product}?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
To understand the intent of {product}, see the xref:user-manual:what-is.adoc[What's?] section in the user manual.
====

.*Why is the project named {product}? What does "ON" mean in {product}?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
The name {product} is a play on words that sounds such as "season" symbolizing a new season for system engineering tools and reflecting progress in the field.
While "ON" doesn't have a single predefined meaning, it evokes activation and readiness—like “you’re ON.”
It can also be interpreted as “Systems ON,” highlighting its role as an enabler for digital engineering, or {sysml} ON, reinforcing its connection to {sysml}.

====

.*Does {product} support modeling in {sysmlv2} graphical notation?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
Yes.
{product} comes with built-in graphical editors for the core {sysmlv2} diagram families (structure, behavior, and requirements).
These editors are implemented with https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html[Sirius Web], so they stay in sync with the underlying model and can be customized through viewpoint extensions without modifying {product}’s code base.
Diagram coverage is expanding—block, interface, activity, and state diagrams are supported today, while sequence diagrams and finer‐grained styling options are on the roadmap.
====

====

.*To what extent will your tool comply with the {sysmlv2} specification?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
{product} aims at full compliance with the {sysmlv2} specification.
{product} already implements the OMG {sysmlv2} metamodel, including both a built-in {sysmlv2} and {kerml} implementation.
====

.*To what extent will your tool comply with the Systems Modeling API & Services specification?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
{product} aims at full compliance with the Systems Modeling API & Services specification.

====

.*Does {product} support model management?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
No, {product} does not provide built-in features for model management such as versioning, branching, or access control.
We believe these concerns are best handled by dedicated Configuration Management (CM) or version control tools, which can be integrated with {product} depending on your environment and needs.
If model management is essential for your project, we encourage you to consult the xref:user-manual:support.adoc[Professional Support] page to explore how we can help you set up the appropriate infrastructure.

====
Yes, {product} supports validation of {sysmlv2} models.
It performs automatic checks to ensure conformance with the {sysmlv2} metamodel and key structural rules.
At this stage, validation results are not yet presented directly within the graphical editors.
However, this is a planned improvement for future versions, to provide more integrated and interactive feedback during modeling.
Additional validation rules can also be added or customized to fit specific modeling guidelines or project requirements.
If you need assistance setting up custom validations, we encourage you to consult the xref:user-manual:support.adoc[Professional Support] page.
====

.*To what extent will your tool support collaborative modeling with configuration management?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
As a web application, {product} is inherently collaborative.
However, it doesn't include a built-in Configuration Management (CM) tool.
We believe that organizations and users should have the freedom to choose their preferred CM tools, and {product} is designed to be flexible enough to integrate with them.

====

.*Does {product} support integration of a {sysmlv2} model with other models?*
[%collapsible%open]
====
{product} is designed to be extensible and can support the integration of {sysmlv2} models with other models or modeling tools, depending on the context.
While there is no built-in, generic model integration feature, {product} provides the technical foundations—such as model import/export, references, and APIs—to enable such integrations.

Common integration scenarios include linking SysML v2 models with requirements (e.g., Polarion), architecture frameworks (e.g., Arcadia), or domain-specific models.
If you have a specific integration need, we encourage you to consult the xref:user-manual:support.adoc[Professional Support] page to explore how we can help you implement it.
====

.*Does {product} provide a capability to link data, trace data, across engineering domain using the {sysmlv2} API and Services?*
[%collapsible%open]
