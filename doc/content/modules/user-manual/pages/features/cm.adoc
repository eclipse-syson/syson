= Version control and change management

{product} doesn't include built-in version control tools.

If you want to manage different versions of your project, you can use an external Git repository.
Here's how:

* For each version or iteration of your project, you can download it as a zip archive by following these instructions: xref:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#download-project[download project].
* Then you can integrate the downloaded zip archive into your Git repository.

Feel free to xref:ROOT:help.adoc[contact us] for more details.
