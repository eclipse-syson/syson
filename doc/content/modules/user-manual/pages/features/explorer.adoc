image::editor-left-sidebar-explorer.png[{editor} Left sidebar Explorer]

* *Models*: Represented by the models existing in the specific project.
* *Semantic Elements*: Located within the models, these are instances of your business domain concepts, each with its own set of children.
* *Representations*: If a particular semantic element has an associated representation, such as a diagram, it appears as a child of the semantic element.
* *Libraries*: A directory containing the standard libraries ({sysml} and {kerml}), as well as user-imported libraries.

== {explorer} Toolbar

At the top of the {explorer}, a toolbar provides quick access to essential actions:

* xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#create-model[Add a Model]: Enables the creation of a new model within the project.
* xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#upload-model[Upload a Model]: Allows users to upload and integrate an external model into the project.
* xref:hands-on/how-tos/explorer.adoc#sync-editor[Synchronize Editor] with Explorer: Ensures alignment between the explorer view and the editor, providing a seamless and up-to-date navigation experience.

== Selection

Users can select any item in the {explorer}:

* Selecting a *Semantic Element*: Displays its properties in the xref:features/details.adoc[Details] view.
If the element is represented on an open representation, the corresponding element (node or edge if it's a diagram) is also selected, and the chosen element is selected in the editor.
* Selecting a *Representation*: Opens it in a new tab or focuses on an existing tab where it was already open.

== {explorer-filter-bar}

The *{explorer-filter-bar}* in the {explorer} view provides the capability to highlight and xref:hands-on/how-tos/explorer.adoc#filter-explorer[filter tree items].

== Drag and Drop

Users can drag and drop semantic elements into another semantic target.
This action will move the elements and their owning memberships to the selected target.

In some cases, a warning will be displayed advising that the drag and drop operation is forbidden for semantic or technical reasons.
For example, dragging to or from a _read-only_ library is forbidden.
