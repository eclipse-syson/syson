= {gv}

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The {gv} is employed to display any members of exposed model elements.
it's the most general view, enabling presentation of any model element.

== Create New General View Diagram

User can create {gv} diagram on any element provided it inherits from Namespace type.

== Element representation

Six categories of elements can be represented on {gv} diagram.

=== _Definition_ elements

The following _Definition_ elements can be displayed in the {gv} diagram:

  * Action Definition,
  * Allocation Definition,
  * Attribute Definition,
  * Constraint Definition,
  * Enumeration Definition,
  * Interface Definition,
  * Item Definition,
  * Metadata Definition,
  * Occurrence Definition,
  * Part Definition,
  * Port Definition,
  * Requirement Definition,
  * UseCase Definition.

_Definition_ elements are represented by rectangular node style.
Keyword with "Def" specification is defined in the label of the node.

=== _Usage_ elements

The following _Usage_ elements can be displayed in the {gv} diagram:

  * Accept Action usage,
  * Action Usage,
  * Allocation Usage,
  * Attribute Usage,
  * Constraint Usage,
  * Interface Usage,
  * Item Usage,
  * Occurrence Usage,
  * Part Usage,
  * Port Usage,
  * Requirement Usage,
  * UseCase Usage.

_Usage_ elements are represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner.

=== Elements in _Definition_ elements

The following element in _Definition_ compartments can be displayed in the {gv} diagram:

  * _Action Definition_ can contain in its body _Action_, _Accept action_, _Start action_, _Done action_, _Fork action_, _Join action_, _Merge action_, _Decision action_ and _Perform action_,
  * Attribute in _Attribute Definition_/_Interface Definition_/_Item Definition_/_Metadata Definition_/_Occurrence Definition_/_Part Definition_/_Port Definition_/_Requirement Definition_,
  * Constraint in _Constraint Definition_,
  * Documentation in all _Definition_ elements,
  * Enumerated Value in _Enumeration Definition_,
  * Interface in _Interface Definition_,
  * Port in _Interface Definition_/_Part Definition_,
  * Reference in _Metadata Definition_/_Port Definition_,
  * Occurrence in _Occurrence Definition_,
  * Assumed Constraint in _Requirement Definition_,
  * Required Constraint in _Requirement Definition_.

Each element in _Definition_ nodes are represented in dedicated compartment.
A _Definition_ node can have several compartments if _Definition_ element can contain many kind of element.
Each compartment is distinguished  by a specific identifier.

=== Elements in _Usage_ elements

The following element in _Usage_ compartments can be displayed in the {gv} diagram:

  * _Action Usage_ can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action,
  * Item in _Action Usage_,
  * Allocation in _Allocation Usage_,
  * Attribute in _Attribute Usage_/_Interface Usage_/_Item Usage_/_Part Usage_/_Port Usage_/_Requirement Usage_,
  * Reference in _Attribute Usage_/_Item Usage_/_Port Usage_,
  * Constraint in _Constraint Usage_,
  * Documentation in all _Usage_ elements,
  * Port in _Interface Usage_/_Part Usage_,
  * Occurrence in _Occurrence Usage_,
  * Assumed Constraint in _Requirement Usage_,
  * Required constraint in _Requirement Usage_.

Each element in _Definition_ nodes are represented in dedicated compartment.
A _Definition_ node can have several compartments  if _Definition_ element can contain many kind of element.
Each compartment is distinguished  by a specific identifier.

=== _Package_ element

_Package_ element can be represented on {gv} diagram.
It is represented by a folder and its label has the keyword `package`.

=== _Annotating_ element

_Annotating_ elements such as _Documentation_ and _Comment_ elements can be represented on {gv} diagram.
It is represented by a note node and its label contains the body of the _Annotating_ element in addition to its declared name.
The label of _Documentation_ node also includes the keyword `doc` whereas the label of _Comment_ node includes the keyword `comment`.

=== Relationship

The following Relationship can be displayed in the {gv} diagram:

* Dependency,

* Subclassification,

image::gv-subclassification-edge.png[{gv} Subclassification Edge]

* Redefinition,

* Succession.
