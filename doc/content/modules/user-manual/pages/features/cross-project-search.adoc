= Cross project search

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature requires {product} to be configured to xref:developer-guide:elasticsearch-integration.adoc[work with Elasticsearch].
====

The _cross project search_ is a feature accessible in the Projects browser's command palette that allows to search for elements in any {product} project.
It is based on https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-query-string-query#query-string-syntax[Elasticsearch's query string], which allows to find elements by matching its indexed fields.

{product} stores each element of a {sysml} model following a xref:developer-guide:elasticsearch-integration.adoc#data-structure[data structure].
The fields defined in this data structure can be used to match elements in the cross project search, for example:

----
// Get all the elements with a name starting with "Batmo"
name:Batmo*

// Get all the Part elements with a name starting with "part" followed by a digit
name:/part<0-9>/ AND @type:Part

// Get all the elements owned by "Package1" 
owner.name:Package1

// Get all the elements typed by "PartDefinition1"
ownedSpecialization.@type:FeatureTyping AND ownedSpecialization.general.name:PartDefinition1
----

Note that the data structure only allows to query nested fields on 2 levels for `Element` instances (e.g. `owner.name`), and 3 levels for `Specialization` instances (e.g. `ownedSpecialization.general.name`).

[NOTE]
====
{sysml} and {kerml} standard libraries are not indexed at the moment for performance reasons.
