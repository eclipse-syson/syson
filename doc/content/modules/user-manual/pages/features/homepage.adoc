== What's the {homepage}?

The **{homepage}** page serves as the pivotal starting point for your modeling endeavors and is the homepage of the {product} application.
It offers a central hub where users can seamlessly create new projects or manage existing ones.

== Find your way around

For newcomers to {product}, the initial experience of opening the application might seem a bit overwhelming.
To assist you in navigating and initiating collaboration with your team, we offer a guided tour to help you acclimate to the platform.

The homepage features three distinct regions: a <<Toolbar>>, a <<Create a New Project>> section, and an <<Existing Projects>> section.
We've streamlined the layout to offer a clear understanding of the content housed in each location.

=== Create a New Project

The _Create New Project_ section is designed to allow users to initiate the creation of a new project.

Within the platform, initiating a new project is a user-friendly process that accommodates various preferences:

* **Create a Blank Project**: Users can start their modeling journey with an empty project, building a project from the ground up.
With blank project, there is no model and no representation at creation.
* **Create a Project from Existing Templates**: For efficiency and consistency, users can select from predefined templates that streamline project initiation, aligning with common modeling scenarios.
The 3 first possible templates are displayed unitary at the beginning of Project sections and they're also available in "Show all templates" section.
For now, there exist three available templates : 

 - _Batmobile- template is a complete SysML project with several concepts of each SysML type (kind of _Definitions_ and _Usages_ with relationships).
 - _SysMLv2_ is an empty SysML project with only the root model, a _Package_ and a {gv} representation.
 - _SysMLv2-Library_ is an empty SysML project with only the root model, a _LibraryPackage_ and a {gv} representation.
* **Upload a Previously Exported Project**: Facilitating collaboration and workflow continuity, users can effortlessly upload a project previously exported, ensuring seamless transitions and flexibility in collaboration.
