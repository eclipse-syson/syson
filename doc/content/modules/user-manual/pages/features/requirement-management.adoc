= Requirements management and traceability

== Creating and linking requirements

By using {product}, requirements can be well integrated and defined  with the {gv}.
Remember that a requirement is a kind of constraint representing the constraints given by stakeholders that a solution must satisfy.
For example, the requirement of a maximum speed of a vehicle.
From the {gv} diagram, user can create a new requirement **from the background** of the diagram from a click that displays toolbar.

User can also create requirement **in other element** such as a requirement.

A Requirement Definition is represented by rectangular node style whereas a Requirement Usage is represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner.

For now, {gv} diagram authorize only to create requirement Definition and Usage.
_Satisfy_ relationship to define connection between requirements aren't available.
Work around requirements are among the topics to be processed soon.

== Requirements view

User can visualize and edit requirements existing inside of a _Package_ (or any other element) in a dedicated view: the Requirements View.

To create a Requirements View, right-click on a _Package_ (or any other element) in the Model Explorer and select `New Representation`, then in the opened popup, select the `Requirement Table View` and set a name.

A new Requirements View looks like this:

It is always empty at the creation.

To populate the Requirements View, use the `Import all existing requirements` button in the toolbar.

After clicking on this button, all requirements existing in the selected element are imported and displayed in the Requirements View.
The sub-requirements are not imported and displayed yet in the table, this will be part of a future development.

User can edit the properties of the requirements directly in the table cells.
For example, the _declaredName_ property can be edited by clicking on the corresponding cell.
Same for the _reqId_ property and the documentation.

User can also create new requirements directly in the Requirements View by clicking on the `New Requirement` button in the toolbar.

After clicking on this button, a new requirement is created and added to the table.

User can delete a requirement by using the "..." button at the end of a requirement line.
Two options are available: `Delete from model` and `Delete from table`.
`Delete from model` will delete the requirement from the model and from the table.
`Delete from table` will only delete the requirement from the table, but it will remain in the model.
