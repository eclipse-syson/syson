= {sysmlv2} textual format

{product} supports {sysmlv2} textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools.
This intent reflects {product}'s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards.

Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from {sysmlv2} textual syntax.
This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows.

Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependencies of this file are also imported, and this, recursively.
Otherwise some relationship wonâ€™t be resolved.

For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations.

Most important {sysmlv2} concepts can be translated from the imported file, some concept are still under development to enable complete import/export capability from and to {sysmlv2} textual syntax.
Stay tuned for updates on its availability in the project.

== Import of a textual {sysmlv2} file

{product} allows to import textual {sysmlv2} files.
Just click on the upload model icon in the _Explorer_ view,

image::import-textual-upload-model-1.png[Textual Import UPLOAD MODEL, width=50%,height=50%]

Select the ".sysml" file you want to import as a model,

image::import-textual-upload-model-2.png[Textual Import SELECT, width=50%,height=50%]

And click on _UPLOAD_ button:

image::import-textual-upload-model-3.png[Textual Import UPLOAD BUTTON, width=50%,height=50%]

The file is now imported as a model.
A message is displayed, reporting the success/failure of the process:

image::import-textual-upload-model-4.png[Textual Import POPUP MESSAGE, width=50%,height=50%]

Click on the _CLOSE_ button to return to the workbench.
The imported file is visible as a model inside a dedicated document in the _Explorer_ view:

The following example shows an example of {sysmlv2} content file to import:

```
package PictureTaking {
    part def Exposure;

	action def Focus { out xrsl: Exposure; }
	action def Shoot { in xsf: Exposure; }

	action takePicture {
		action focus: Focus[1];
		flow focus.xrsl to shoot.xsf;
		action shoot: Shoot[1];
	}
}
```

== Import of a textual {sysmlv2} content

It is also possible to import textual {sysmlv2} content, but not as a file.
Just select an element in the _Explorer_ view and click on the _New objects from text_ context menu:

image::import-textual-new-objects-from-text-1.png[Textual Import New Objects from text, width=50%,height=50%]

It's convenient when you want to import textual {sysmlv2} content inside an element.

From there, a popup is opened, allowing to type any textual {sysmlv2} content:

image::import-textual-new-objects-from-text-2.png[Textual Import New Objects from text, width=85%,height=85%]

Then, just click on _CREATE OBJECTS_ button, and wait for the process to end.
If something went wrong, the popup will display an error message.
If everything is ok, the popup will close.

Back on the _Explorer_ view, the new objects are visible under the selected element:

image::import-textual-new-objects-from-text-3.png[Textual Import New Objects from text, width=50%,height=50%]

== Export to textual {sysmlv2} file

To export a model as a textual {sysmlv2} file, just click on the _Download_ context menu of a document in the _Explorer_ view:

image::export-textual-download.png[Textual Export Download context menu, width=50%,height=50%]

[WARNING]
====
The document must be suffixed by ".sysml" to be downloaded as a textual {sysmlv2} file.
