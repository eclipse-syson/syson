= {query-view}

A view named _Query_ is available in {product}, allowing users to query the models.

image::query-view-overview.png[Query View, width=85%,height=85%]

This view allows to write AQL queries (see https://eclipse.dev/acceleo/documentation/[AQL documentation] for more details) and get the results of the queries written.
[WARNING]
====
This view comes from https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html[{sw}], the software on which {product} is based upon.
It will be improved release after release, with new variables and services, but it's experimental for now.
====
Three variables are accessible for now, helping to write queries:
- `self` which represents the selected element in the Explorer and/or any open diagram.
It always returns one element.
- `selection` which represents the selected elements in the Explorer and/or any open diagram.
It always returns a collection of elements (one or several).
- `editingContext` which represent the current project.
From this context, you can use the following services:

 - `Collection<Object> allContents()`: allows to retrieve all contents recursively (documents, and each element of all models) present in your editing context.
Use this service very carefully as it can retrieve thousands elements very easily and can also lead to performance issues.
 - `Collection<Object> contents()`: allows to retrieve all contents (documents) present in your editing context.
 - `Object getObjectById(String id)`: from its ID, allows to retrieve an object (a document or a {sysmlv2} model Element) present in your editing context.

[WARNING]
====
The use of this _Query_ view requires knowledge of AQL and also a good knowledge of the {sysmlv2} language (attributes, references, operations).
====
Here are some examples of AQL queries applied on a simple project:

- The following example uses the `self` variable, corresponding to the _Package 1_ element (which has been selected in the _Explorer_ view), and asking for its name:

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_Package 1_).

- The following example uses the `selection` variable, corresponding to the _part1_ and _part2_ elements (which have been selected in the _General View_ diagram), and asking for the number of selected elements:

image::query-view-selection.png[Query View selection]

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_2_).

- The following example uses the `getObjectById` service with an ID as parameter, corresponding to the _Package 1_ element (its ID has been retrieved from the _Advanced_ tab in _Details_ view):

image::query-view-getObjectById.png[Query View getObjectById]

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_Package 1_).

- The following example uses the `ownedMember` reference from the {sysmlv2} language, applied on _Package 1_ element:

image::query-view-ownedMember.png[Query View ownedMember]

The result is visible in the _Evaluation result_ part of the _Query_ view (_part1_ and _action1_).
In this case it corresponds to the members of _Package 1_ that you can also see in the _Explorer_ view on the left side of the preceding screenshot.
