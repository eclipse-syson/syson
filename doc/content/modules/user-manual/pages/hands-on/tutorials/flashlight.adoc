= Model Your First System

This tutorial provides a beginner-friendly guide to creating your first system with {sysmlv2} and {product}, adapted from the training https://de-bok.org/asset/cea7b8e36bf22cb43cc0ca277528bb57127fb292[{sysmlv2} Introductory Training Flashlight Starter Model] by Sanford Friedenthal.
The focus is on representing a flashlight.

== Step 1: Create a Project
. Open the {homepage} and xref:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#create-template-project[create a new {sysmlv2} project] by clicking on the {sysmlv2} card.
. The {editor} automatically opens, creating a new project named `{sysmlv2}` with a package `Package1`.
A default `{gv}` representation associated with the package is opened in the main editor area.
. From the project toolbar, xref:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#rename-project[rename the project] to `Flashlight`.
. From the {explorer}, xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#rename-model[rename the model] to `Flashlight.sysml` and the xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#rename-element[package] to `Flashlight_StarterModel`.

== Step 2: Model Organization (Package Structure)

. In the main editor area, right-click on the diagram background to open the palette.
. Click on `Structure` -> `New Package` to create a new package.
. Rename the package to `FlashlightSpecificationAndDesign`.
. Right-click on the `FlashlightSpecificationAndDesign` package, select `Structure` -> `New Package` to create a new package inside it.
. Rename it to `Requirements`.
. Right-click again on the `FlashlightSpecificationAndDesign`, and use the quick access tool `New Package`.
. Rename it to `ActionTree`.
. Repeat the earlier step to create and rename the following packages inside `FlashlightSpecificationAndDesign`:
** `PartsTree`
** `RequirementsAllocation`
. Click on the `Arrange all elements` menu in the global toolbar at the top of the diagram.

== Step 3: Flashlight Requirements Tree

. In the `Explorer` view, select the `Requirements` package, click the "more" menu, and choose `New representation` 
. Set the name of the representation to `Requirements General View`.
. Create a new `General View` and open it.
. In the main editor area, right-click on the diagram background to open the palette.
. Click on `Requirements` -> `New Requirement` to create a new requirement.
. Rename it to `flashlightSpecification`.
. Right-click on the `flashlightSpecification` requirement, then select `Requirements` -> `New Requirement` to create a nested requirement.
. Rename the new requirement to `userInterface`.
. In the `Explorer` view, select `flashlightSpecification`, click the "more" menu, and choose `New objects from text`.
. In the modal input box, paste the following content:
[source, sysml]
----
requirement illumination{
 requirement fieldOfView{
  doc /* The flashlight field of view shall be 0 - 20 degrees.*/
 }
requirement lightPower{
 doc /* The light power shall be a minimum of TBD lumens.*/
 }
}
requirement physical{
 requirement portability;
 requirement size{
  doc /* The flashlight shall be less than 6 inches in length.*/
 }
 requirement weight;
}
requirement reliability;
requirement cost;
----
. Select the newly created elements (`illumination`, `physical`, `reliability`, `cost`, `portability`, `size`, `weight`, `fieldOfView`, `lightPower`) in the `Explorer` view (Ctrl + Click), and drag-and-drop them into the diagram.
. Use the `Arrange all elements` tool from the diagram toolbar to auto layout the diagram.
. Right-click on the `size` requirement and select `Show/Hide -> Show valued content` to display the documentation in the diagram.
. Repeat the operation for the children of `illumination`: `fieldOfView` and `lightPower`.
. Right-click on the `weight` requirement and select the `New Documentation` tool.
. In the newly created `doc` element, enter the text:  `The weight shall be less than 0.25 kg.`
. Right-click on the `weight` requirement again and choose `Structure -> New Attribute`.
. Edit the new attribute to `actualweight :> mass`.
This well set the _declaredName_ property of the attribute to `actualweight` and its type to `mass` (automatically imported from the standard library `ISQBase`).
. Right-click on the background of diagram and use the tool `New Namespace Import`.
It is located in the `Structure` section of the palette.
Then select `SI/Library Package SI` to import it from the standard libraries.
This will allow you to use standard units, such as the kilogram.
. Use the palette filter to locate the `New Required Constraint` tool, and apply it to the `weight` requirement.
. In the `require constraints` compartment of the `weight` requirement, edit the constraint to: `actualweight \<= 0.25 [kg]`
This will set the predicate of the constraint.

== Step 4: Produce Directed Light Action Flow

. In the `Explorer` view, select the `ActionTree` package, click the "more" menu, and choose `New representation`.
. Set the name of the representation to `Action Tree ActionFlow View`.
. Create a new `ActionFlow View` and open it.
. In the main editor area, right-click on the diagram background to open the palette.
. Click on `Behavior` -> `New Action` to create a new action.
. Rename it `produceDirectedLight`.
. Right-click on the `produceDirectedLight` action, then select `Behavior` -> `New Start Action`.
. Right-click again on `produceDirectedLight`, then select `Behavior` -> `New Fork`.
. Rename the fork to `fork1`.
. Select the start node and use the connection tool to create a succession between the start action and the fork node.
. Right-click on the `produceDirectedLight` and select `Behavior` -> `New Action` to create a nested action.
. Rename the nested action to `provideDCPwr`.
. Select `fork1` and use the connection tool to create a succession to the `provideDCPwr` action.
. Right-click on `provideDCPwr`, then select `Structure`-> `New Item Out`.
. Rename the item to `outdcPwr`.
. In the `Explorer` view, select the `produceDirectedLight` action, click the "more" menu, and choose `New objects from text`.
. In the model input box, paste the following content:
[source,sysml]
----
in item onOffCmd;
out item lightOut;
action connectDCPwr {
  	in item onOffCmd;
  	in item dcPwrIn;
  	out item dcPwrOut;
}
action generateLight{
  	in item dcPwrIn;
  	out item light;
}
action directLight{
  	in item lightIn;
  	out item lightOut;
}
----
. In the `action flow` compartment of `produceDirectLight` use the tool `Related Elements -> Add existing element`.
. Create a new transition between `fork1` and `connectDCPwr`.
. Set the value of `connectDCPwr::onOffCmd` by renaming the item `in onOffCmd` of `connectDCPwr` to `in onOffCmd = produceDirectedLight.onOffCmd`.
. Create a `Flow Connection (flow)` from `dcPwrOut` of `connectDCPwr` to  `dcPwrIn` of `generateLight`.
. Create a `Flow Connection (flow)` between `light` of `generateLight` to `lightIn` of `directLight`.
. Create a `Flow Connection (flow)` between `outdcPwr` of `provideDCPwr` to `dcPwrIn` of `connectDCPwr`.
. Using the eye icon on the `produceDirectLight` action display the `items` compartment.
. Set the value of `produceDirectedLight::lightOut` by renaming the item `out lightOut` of `produceDirectedLight` to `out lightOut = directLight.lightOut`.
