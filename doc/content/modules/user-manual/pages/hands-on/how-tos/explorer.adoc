= {explorer}

[#select]
== Select in {explorer}

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

Allows to select in the {explorer} view what is selected in the main editor area (in the visible diagram/table).

[#expand-all]
== Expand all

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

[WARNING]
====
This operation may take a considerable amount of time for projects with a massive hierarchy and a high number of children.
Exercise caution when performing this action in such scenarios.
====

Explore the hierarchy of children for any element in the {explorer}:

. Open the {explorer-menu} of any element with children.
. Click `Expand all`.

This action expands the selected element and all its children recursively, offering a detailed view of the hierarchical structure.

[#explorer-filter]
== Filter elements in the {explorer}

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

=== Filter from name

To filter elements in the {explorer} using the filter bar:

. Choose a tree item in the {explorer}.
. Press `Ctrl+f` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+f` (MacOS) to enable the filter bar.
. Enter a value in the filter bar.
+
image::hands-on-filter-name-shortcut.png[Filter name shortcut]
+
. All visible tree items containing the typed value are highlighted.
. Use the filter button inside the filter bar to hide all visible tree items that don't contain the entered value.

This capability allows for precise filtering and highlighting of elements based on specified criteria.

[NOTE]
====
The filter bar can only highlight items in the expanded state; it doesn't search within unexpanded children.
Ensure the desired tree items are expanded to effectively use the filter and highlight capability.
====

[#filter-explorer]
=== Filter from kind

Six filters are available in the {explorer} to filter element by kind:

* Hide Memberships,
* Hide {kerml} Standard Libraries,
* Hide {sysml} Standard Libraries.
* Hide Root Namespaces
* Hide User Librairies
* Hide Root Namespaces

These filters allow to clear the {explorer} view.
By hiding the technical elements, only the data directly exploited by the user are displayed, which make the model more readable in the {explorer} view.

To filter elements in the {explorer} by their kind using the filter tool:

. Click filter button,
. Select filters to activate.

[#duplicate-element]
== Duplicate an Element

To duplicate elements in the {explorer}, use the contextual menu _Duplicate object_.

[NOTE]
====
This action is only available on SysML `Elements` which are not `Relationships`.
====

In the dialog:

* Choose the target that will own the duplicated element.
* In the drop-down list, choose the type of `Membership` to use if several kinds are available.

Optionally, the following options can be used:

* _Duplicate the content_ : When selected, the element **and its contained elements** are duplicated.
Otherwise, only the selected element itself is duplicated.

* _Copy outgoing references_ : When selected, all outgoing references (e.g. type references, usage links…) are preserved in the duplicated element.

Example:

```
private ScalarValues::*

part p1 {
  attribute x : Real
}
```

If `x` is duplicated **without** _Copy outgoing references_, the duplicate will **not** have its `type` set to `ScalarValues::Real`.

[NOTE]
====
It is strongly recommended to keep this option enabled to ensure a consistent model.
====

* _Update incoming reference_ : This option is not yet fully implemented in SysON and currently has no effect.
