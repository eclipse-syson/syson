[#sync-editor]
== Synchronize {explorer} / {editor}

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

It's possible to turn-off and turn-on the synchronization between the {explorer} and the current selection in the {editor}.

When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the {explorer} view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected.
This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the {explorer}â€™s view.

When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an {explorer} view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing.

The `Synchronize` toggle button in the {explorer} can be used to disable this synchronization.

When synchronization is disabled, tree items that are already expanded in the {explorer} are still selected, but no new tree items are automatically expanded.

[#expand-all]
== Expand all

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

[WARNING]
====
This operation may take a considerable amount of time for projects with a massive hierarchy and a high number of children.
Exercise caution when performing this action in such scenarios.
====

Explore the hierarchy of children for any element in the {explorer}:

. Open the {explorer-menu} of any element with children.
. Click `Expand all`.

This action expands the selected element and all its children recursively, offering a detailed view of the hierarchical structure.

[#explorer-filter]
== Filter elements in the {explorer}

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

=== Filter from name

To filter elements in the {explorer} using the filter bar:

. Choose a tree item in the {explorer}.
. Press `Ctrl+f` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+f` (MacOS) to enable the filter bar.
. Enter a value in the filter bar.
+

+
. All visible tree items containing the typed value are highlighted.
. Use the filter button inside the filter bar to hide all visible tree items that don't contain the entered value.

This capability allows for precise filtering and highlighting of elements based on specified criteria.

[NOTE]
====
The filter bar can only highlight items in the expanded state; it doesn't search within unexpanded children.
Ensure the desired tree items are expanded to effectively use the filter and highlight capability.

[#filter-explorer]
=== Filter from kind

Three filters are available in the {explorer} to filter element by kind:

* Hide Memberships,
* Hide {kerml} Standard Libraries,
* Hide {sysml} Standard Libraries.

These filters allow to clear the {explorer} view.
By hiding the technical elements, only the data directly exploited by the user are displayed, which make the model more readable in the {explorer} view.

To filter elements in the {explorer} by their kind using the filter tool:

. Click filter button,
. Select filters to activate.
