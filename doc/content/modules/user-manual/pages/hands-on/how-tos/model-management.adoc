image::hands-on-new-element.png[Create New Element]

Upon completion, the newly created element is automatically selected in the {explorer}.

== Read an element

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

. To navigate through the details of a semantic element, use the {explorer} to navigate through the model and locate the needed element.
. Select the element in the {explorer}.
. On the right sidebar, access the {details} view.
This view presents all the available properties for the selected element, providing a comprehensive overview of its characteristics.

[#rename-element]
== Rename an element

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

It's possible to rename an element either from the {explorer}, the {details} view or a representation.

=== From the {explorer}

You can update the element name from the {explorer}:

. Click the {explorer-menu} next to the element in the {explorer}.
. Select the `Rename` option.
. Update the name in the editable field.
. Click `Rename`.

image::hands-on-rename-element-from-project-editor.png[Rename element from project explorer]

Alternatively, cancel the operation by pressing the `ESC` key.

=== From the {details} view

You can update the element properties from the {details} view:

. Select the property in the {details} view.
. Update the value in the editable field.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

image::hands-on-rename-element-from-details.png[Rename element from Details]

=== From a representation

You can update the element name from a representation (diagram...):

. Select the element in the representation.
. Select the `Edit` tool in the {diag-toolbar}.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

image::hands-on-rename-element-from-representation.png[Rename element from representation]

Alternatively, cancel the operation by pressing the `ESC` key.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of using the tool in the toolbar, you can press `F2` key or start typing the new value directly to efficiently update the element name.
====

[#update-element]
== Update an element

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

It's possible to update element properties either from the {details} view or a representation.

[#details]
=== From the {details} view

You can update the element properties from the {details} view:

. Select the property in the {details} view.
. Update the value in the editable field.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

[#representation]
=== From a representation

You can update the element name from a representation (diagram...):

. Select the element in the representation.
. Select the `Edit` tool in the {diag-toolbar}.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

[TIP]
====
Instead of using the tool in the toolbar, you can press `F2` key or start typing the new value directly to efficiently update the element name.

[TIP]
====
A powerful syntax exists for editing element properties directly through the direct edit tool; refer to xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#direct-edit[Direct Edit Tool and Shortcuts] for details.
====

[#delete-element]
== Delete an element

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

[WARNING]
====
This operation is irreversible, once done there is no mean to get the element back.
The element and its children - semantic element and representations - are deleted.
====

[NOTE]
====
The deletion affects everyone.
====

To delete an element, follow these steps:

=== From the {explorer}

. Open the {explorer-menu} next to the element.
. Click `Delete`.

image::hands-on-delete-element-from-explorer.png[Delete element from explorer]

=== From a representation

. Select the element in the representation.
. Click the `Delete` tool in the {diag-toolbar} or press the `DEL` key on your keyboard.

image::hands-on-delete-element-from-representation.png[Delete element from representation]

CAUTION: Use the `DEL` key cautiously, as it's a direct shortcut for the delete operation.

A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the _Delete from model_ tool in the palette or via the {explorer-menu}.
This behavior can be disabled by checking the "Disable this confirmation dialog" checkbox in the dialog.

[#direct-edit]
== Direct edit tool and shortcuts

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The {product} supports a subset of the {sysmlv2} textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously.
This makes it more efficient to edit models.

In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties.

WARNING: If an element has a complex name such as `someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement`, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values.

Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing {product} models:

* Typing `someName` updates the name of the selected element.
* Typing `:SomeTypeName`, sets the type of the selected element to _SomeTypeName_.
If _SomeTypeName_ doesn't exist, it's created as an appropriate type element (for example `Item Definition`, `Part Definition`, ...) within the same parent container as the selected element.
* Typing `[x]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _x_.
* Typing `[1..x]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _1..x_.
* Typing `[x..*]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _x..*_.
* Typing `someElement:>otherElement` on a element sets _someElement_ as a `subsetting` of the _otherElement_ if both element are of the same type.
Otherwise, it creates a `specialization` relationship between _someElement_ and _otherElement_.
* Typing `someElement:>>otherElement` on an element sets _someElement_ as a `redefinition` of _otherElement_.

These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.
