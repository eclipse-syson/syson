. Select the `Edit` tool in the {diag-toolbar}.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

image::hands-on-rename-element-from-representation.png[Rename element from representation]

Alternatively, cancel the operation by pressing the `ESC` key.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of using the tool in the toolbar, you can press `F2` key or start typing the new value directly to efficiently update the element name.
====

[#update-element]
== Update an element

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

It's possible to update element properties either from the {details} view or a representation.

You can update the element properties from the {details} view:

. Select the property in the {details} view.
. Update the value in the editable field.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.

[#representation]
=== From a representation

You can update the element name from a representation (diagram...):

. Select the element in the representation.
. Select the `Edit` tool in the {diag-toolbar}.

[#direct-edit]
== Direct edit tool and shortcuts

include::user-manual:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The {product} supports a subset of the {sysmlv2} textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously.
This makes it more efficient to edit models.

In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties.

WARNING: If an element has a complex name such as `someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement`, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values.

Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing {product} models:

* Typing `someName` updates the name of the selected element.
* Typing `<someShortName>` updates the short name of the selected element.
If _someShortName_ is empty (i.e. when typing `<>`) the short name of the selected element is deleted.
* Typing `:SomeTypeName`, sets the type of the selected element to _SomeTypeName_.
If _SomeTypeName_ doesn't exist, it's created as an appropriate type element (for example `Item Definition`, `Part Definition`, ...) within the same parent container as the selected element.
* Typing `[x]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _x_.
* Typing `[1..x]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _1..x_.
* Typing `[x..*]` on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to _x..*_.
* Typing `someElement:>otherElement` on a element sets _someElement_ as a `subsetting` of the _otherElement_ if both element are of the same type.
Otherwise, it creates a `specialization` relationship between _someElement_ and _otherElement_.
* Typing `someElement:>>otherElement` on an element sets _someElement_ as a `redefinition` of _otherElement_.
* On a `Feature`, typing `= someExpression` sets a bounded value to the feature (at the moment only `LiteralExpression` are handled in the expression part).
* On a `Feature`, typing  `:= someExpression` sets an initial value to the feature (at the moment only `LiteralExpression` are handled in the expression part).
* On a `Feature`, typing  the symbol `default` before the symbols `=` or `:=` makes the bounded or initial value "default" (to be opposed as "fixed" if the symbol is not present).

These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.

[WARNING]
====
When using the direct edit tool to set the name of an `Element` be aware that the following keywords would not be accepted in the name part of your input:

* ':'
* ':>'
* '::>'
* ':>>'
* '=' 
* ':='
* '['
* ' default'
* ' ordered'
* ' nonunique'

To be able to use those in the name of the `Element`, use the "name" field in the {details} view.
