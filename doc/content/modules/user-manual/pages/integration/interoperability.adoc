= Interoperability

The interoperability inherent in an open source tool such as {product} is a cornerstone for collaborative design of complex systems.
In the context of {mbse} - `MBSE`, where diverse teams contribute to different facets of a project, having an open source tool becomes a unifying force.
It allows seamless collaboration and information exchange among stakeholders, regardless of their preferred tools or methodologies.

== Seamless transition between representations
{product} empowers users to seamlessly transition between graphical and textual representations, accommodating diverse modeling preferences and the specific demands of the systems under analysis.
This flexibility is crucial in `MBSE`, where the ability to articulate and refine models in different modalities is instrumental in capturing the complexity inherent in modern system designs.

== Tailoring to domain-specific requirements
The extensibility of {sysmlv2} within {product} is a key aspect that reinforces its adaptability to diverse industries and complex project landscapes.
In `MBSE`, where each domain might have unique requirements and specifications, having a tool that can be tailored to meet these specific needs is invaluable.
{product}'s extensibility ensures that it remains a dynamic and adaptable resource for system engineers working across various domains.

== Evolution guided by {sysmlv2} principles
As {product} evolves, guided by the principles of {sysmlv2}, it positions itself as more than just a tool; it evolves into a comprehensive and standardized environment for `MBSE` endeavors.
The commitment to open source and interoperability serves as a cornerstone for future developments, ensuring that {product} continues to meet the evolving needs of the `MBSE` community.

In essence, {product} stands as an open source enabler, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and adaptabilityâ€”fundamental principles in the ever-evolving landscape of `MBSE`.

== Import and export

=== JSON format

{product} extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format.
This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms.

WARNING: {product} doesn't  support the {sysmlv2} Standard JSON format for import/export.

For detailed instructions on xref:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#download-project[downloading projects], xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#download-model[downloading models], xref:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#upload-project[uploading projects], and xref:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#upload-model[uploading models], please refer to the respective sections in the documentation.
These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the {product} environment.

=== {sysmlv2} textual format

{product} supports {sysmlv2} textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools.
This intent reflects {product}'s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards.

Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from {sysmlv2} textual syntax.
This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows.

More details are explained on xref:features/import-export-textual.adoc[Textual Import/Export] page.
