== Manage existing elements

From the diagram background or from a given node, it's possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection.

User just need to display the palette and unfold _Existing elements_ section.

User can click on _Add existing elements_ to display elements directly contained by the selection.
User can also click on _Add existing elements (recursive)_ to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on.

=== Expose Package

When a _Package_ is created in a diagram, it is exposed in the _ViewUsage_ corresponding to the diagram, as any other element created from the diagram.

By default, the expose element (a _MembershipExpose_) corresponding to the _Package_ is not set to recursive.
It means that every element created inside the _Package_ will be automatically exposed in the _ViewUsage_, in its own expose element (a _MembershipExpose_).

If user wants to expose all elements contained by the _Package_, user can set the expose element corresponding to the _Package_ to recursive.
In the _Details_ view of the expose element corresponding to the _Package_, just check the _is Recursive_ property.
Then you will see a "::**" at the end of the expose element label in the _Explorer_ view.

When the _is Recursive_ property, all elements contained by the _Package_ are automatically visible inside the _Package_ graphical node in the diagram.
No new expose element will be created in the _ViewUsage_ when a new element will be created inside the _Package_ graphical node. 
In this case, this also means that the _Delete from Diagram_ action will have no effect on those elements.
