[TIP]
====
This view in {product} is implemented as an *unsynchronized* diagram.
This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them.
It doesn't display all the information stored in the model by default.
It relies on the exposed elements of the _ViewUsages_, on which the diagrams are created.
