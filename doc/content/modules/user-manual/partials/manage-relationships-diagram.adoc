Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types.

If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded.

It is not possible for now to create a graphical edge between two graphical edges or between a graphical edge and a graphical node.

NOTE: In some cases, if {product} detects that the relationship you try to create already exists and creating a duplicate is not valid, it will tell you with a feedback message instead of creating a redundant relationship.

=== Reconnect relationship

Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element.

If the new source or the new target isn't allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded.

=== Delete relationship

To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button.

Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it's not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram.
