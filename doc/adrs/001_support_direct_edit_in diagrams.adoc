= ADR-001 - Support direct edit in diagrams

== Context

In General View diagram (and maybe other diagrams existing in the future), we need to perform direct edit (e.g. renaming an element) on some diagram elements (i.e. nodes and edges).

Change the name of a SysML element is the easiest case while performing a direct edit.
But there are many other direct edit much more complex than simply change the name of an element.

For example, the General View diagram displays `PartUsage` as container node.
These container node contains a compartment for its attributes (i.e. `AttributeUsage`).
An `AttributeUsage` may have a type, may redefine another `AttributeUsage`, may have a value (simple or complex) affected, ...
Furthermore, an `AttributeUsage` can be represented as a compartment node inside a `Usage`` container node, but can also be represented as a container node.
Depending on this kind of node, we do not want to display the same level of information, and we do not want to edit the same level of information.

We also want to create elements on the fly.
For example, on an `AttributeUsage` that only have a name 'attr1', performing a direct edit from `attr1` to `attr1 : MyType` should create a `FeatureTyping` element and reference the type `MyType` in this newly created `FeatureTyping`.
But it should also create the type `MyType` if it does not exist.

We also want to delete elements on the fly.
For example, on an `AttributeUsage` 'attr1' that redefines another `AttributeUsage` 'attr2' (meaning a `Redefinition` element exists under `attr1` and references `attr2`), performing a direct edit from `attr1 :>> attr2` to `attr1` should delete the `Redefinition` element existing under `attr1`.

These examples give a small insight of what can be done with the direct edit.

== Decision

For simple cases, the usage of `String.split(...)` or a regular expression may be the technical solution to handle the direct edit.
For complex cases (like the ones described above), a parser could help to manage this complexity (several elements to update/create/delete, optional parts...).

The decision is to use ANTLR parser to handle these complex cases.
It will be used to create grammars dedicated to parse these complex cases.
The first use case will be the direct edit of all `Usage` elements (`AttributeUsage`, `PartUsage`, `PortUsage`, ...) that are represented as compartment nodes inside node containers.
Other use cases (unknown at the moment) may also use the same grammar or new ones depending on the context.

== Consequences

`syson-diagram-general-view` will depend on `antlr4-runtime` as maven dependency.
The version used will be the same as Sirius Web, ANTLR 4.10.1.
SysON will keep its version of ANTLR synchronized with the Sirius Web one.
